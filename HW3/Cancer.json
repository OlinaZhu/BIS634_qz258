        "title": "Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos",
        "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos, who have a unique demographic profile that departs from the US public health pattern. Latinos have a lower incidence than non-Latino whites for some common cancers such as breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate, yet they are disproportionately affected by some less common cancers, such as gall bladder and infection-related cancers of the liver, intrahepatic bile duct, stomach, and uterine cervix. In addition to increased incidence for some cancers, US Latinos experience other cancer disparities. For one, cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage in Latinos when the disease is more difficult to treat, perhaps the result of economic and cultural barriers to cancer care and lower use of prevention screening. Second, accurately characterizing Latino cancer risk is challenging, because Latinos are underrepresented in cancer registries, research, and clinical trials. Thus, these data do not reflect the proportion of Latinos in the US population. Compounding the problem is the fact that these data commonly consider Latinos as a single group when, in fact, Latinos are heterogeneous and may differ by genetic admixture, country of origin, nativity, degree of acculturation, and socioeconomic status&#8212;all factors that have been implicated in cancer risk. The conference, Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos, brought together cancer disparities researchers to discuss the latest research findings, identify knowledge gaps, and stimulate ideas for new research in cancer health disparities among Latinos. Conference topics covered the entire cancer continuum, including advances in risk assessment, primary prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer and leading cause of cancer death for Latina women in the United States. Latinos are the fastest-growing minority group in the nation, encompassing individuals from multiple countries and cultures and with a wide range of genetic ancestry influences including Indigenous American, European, African, and to a lesser extent, Asian. Breast cancer risk, characteristics, and outcomes differ between populations and among individuals in the same population group according to nationality, place of birth, and genetic ancestry, with the added intersection of socioeconomic status. Most of the observed differences are explained by barriers in access to health care, lifestyle, and health-related behaviors. However, there is evidence that underlying genetic differences might also contribute to the observed heterogeneity. This article summarizes what is known about breast cancer incidence, tumor characteristics, and survival in women of Latin American origin, with emphasis on the heterogeneous nature of this group of individuals usually identified with the categories of Hispanics or Latinos.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

CRC is currently the first and third leading cause of cancer-related death in Puerto Rico and in the United States&#160;(US), respectively. The CRC racial/ethnic health disparities reported among&#160;mainland US Hispanics and Puerto Rican Hispanics may result from a combination of environmental and genetic factors including nutrition, genetic predisposition, and gut microbiome composition. The incidence of CRC among Hispanics who move to the US&#160;is higher than in their native countries, supporting the hypothesis that environmental exposure is a major risk factor for the development of CRC. In addition to disparities in CRC incidence and mortality, an age-associated CRC disparity has been noted among Hispanics; the number of CRC cases among Hispanics <50&#160;years of age (early-onset CRC) has increased dramatically in both mainland US and Puerto Rican Hispanics. Our current work focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to decreased CRC survival among Puerto Rican Hispanics, the genetics associated with early onset CRC, the association of genetic ancestry and specific SNPs identified through GWAS with CRC risk in this population, and the association between dietary patterns and gut bacterial toxins with colorectal neoplasia risk. In sum, our work is providing a better understanding of the underlying factors contributing to CRC health disparities among Puerto Rican Hispanics.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos/Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States. Their cancer burden has nearly doubled in 15 years, with 129,000 new cancer cases nationwide in 2014. As this relatively young Hispanic population ages, this burden will inevitably increase; thus, accurate characterization of the Hispanic cancer experience is critical. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge on cancer in Hispanics, with a focus on the imperative of disaggregating by specific Hispanic group (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central Americans, South Americans, and Dominicans) and nativity. We also describe for the first time some major methodological challenges in determining accurate cancer indicators for specific Hispanic groups and suggest approaches to overcome these hurdles. Our research shows that cancer patterns by specific Hispanic group can be quite distinct according to country of origin, particularly among the first-generation immigrants. For the second-generation Latinos and beyond, patterns for obesity-related cancers, poverty-related cancers, and particularly liver cancer are intriguing, and often parallel patterns are seen among other disadvantaged US minority groups. Unsurprisingly, birthplace (US- vs. foreign-born) used as a proxy measure of acculturation is a strong confounder in epidemiological analyses, dramatically influencing cancer indicators. Disaggregation of Hispanic groups should frame efforts to formulate cancer prevention and control strategies to address the needs of the burgeoning US Latino population.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "In South Texas, smoking rates among young Latino adults aged 18&#8211;29 are high (23.2%&#8211;25.7%). This is a serious public health problem, yet few are reached by services to help them quit smoking. Cellular phones have an extraordinary potential for assisting smoking cessation by providing access to peer modeling and social reinforcement for behavior change. Quitxt is a bilingual text-messaging and mobile media service designed at UT Health San Antonio to help young adults quit smoking. Text messages include links to web content and YouTube videos with peer modeling of reasons and skills to quit smoking. Quitxt was promoted in South Texas via social media advertising and other recruitment channels. An assessment of the program included 798 participants with a mean age of 29&#160;years; 57% were males and 36% identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino. The mean number of cigarettes consumed per day was 11.5. Abstinence was assessed at 2, 4, and 7&#160;months; at the 7-month follow up, 21% reported abstinence. This is consistent with high success rates found in studies of telephone counseling for young adults and confirms that text messaging services specifically designed for young adults are a feasible and cost-effective way to promote smoking cessation. Young adult smokers in South Texas can be reached via mobile media service. This highly scalable service makes mobile, personalized, smoking-cessation advice/support an affordable approach to reach disadvantaged population groups, affect public health, reduce health service costs, and reduce smoking-related health disparities.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "title": "Prostate Cancer in US Latinos: What Have We Learned and Where Should We Focus Our Attention",
        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer diagnosis among Latino men, with more than 13,000 diagnosed cases per year in the United States. Overall, PCa incidence among Latino men is lower than that among non-Latino Whites or Blacks, and disparities in incidence have been reported within Latino subpopulations, with Mexican Latinos having lower incidence than Caribbean Latinos. The determinants of these observed disparities remain to be identified and could result from the interplay between differences in genetic ancestry, environmental exposures, and attitudes toward screening and care, or a consequence of lack of identification of all Latino patients with PCa. Most PCa diagnoses are triggered by screening with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Latinos show lower rates of PSA cancer screening; thus, current reported rates among Latinos might be underestimated. Latinos show a higher proportion of cases diagnosed with advanced stages, along with other adverse characteristics. Disparities have been reported for clinical characteristics and survival patterns between foreign- and US-born Latinos, different socioeconomic status, and Latino subpopulations defined by country of origin. Given that PCa is the number one cancer that affects Latino men and the number four killer, it is imperative to reduce the gap of knowledge about cancer determinants and outcomes among Latinos, taking into consideration sources of heterogeneity within this population. This study reviews current knowledge on prostate cancer in Latinos and highlights important gaps of knowledge that deserve further study.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Precision medicine in oncology aims to treat a patient based on the molecular makeup of the individual&#8217;s tumor. Guidelines have already been adopted in certain tumor types for the use of targeted therapies as standard of care, including lung, colon and rectum, thyroid, kidney, and breast cancers; melanoma; and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Of these tumor types, Latinos have a higher overall incidence rate of colorectal cancer and a higher overall mortality rate from thyroid cancer than non-Latino whites in the United States, though these trends may vary by state. While the potential benefit of precision medicine is substantial, research has shown that its implementation in the Latino population is limited. At the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (RCINJ), during 2013&#8211;2017, 65.3% of new patient visits were non-Latino white patients and 8.9% were Latino. In a clinical trial evaluating the outcomes of patients who have had genomic testing on their tumors (N&#160;=&#160;770), 71% were non-Latino white patients, while 11% were Latino. This ongoing trial consistently demonstrates that targeted therapy based on genomic profiling of tumors improves outcomes in cancer care and that Latinos are willing to participate in the clinical trial that involves genomic testing at a cancer center.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide. There is a significant diversity in risk and aggressiveness associated with the disease in terms of factors such as ethnicity, age, and diet. However, one thing that is common is the fact that infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is often associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Infection with H. pylori induces a series of events that lead to non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia, and cancer. All the premalignant, proinflammatory stages are treatable, but it has been shown that the rate of progression to more advanced lesions is higher than the rate of regression. Most of the research efforts have focused on understanding the cancer stage, but there is still a large gap in the knowledge of biomarkers of the inflammatory stages and those of the progression/regression. Using samples from African American and Caucasian individuals with gastritis, we have been able to identify specific sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in cytokine genes associated with ethnicity. Interestingly, those same SNPs are also associated with advanced gastric lesions. On the other hand, using a cohort of Hispanic/Latino individuals with gastritis, we identified CD44 as a marker of disease progression and DMBT1 as a marker of disease aggressiveness. Both markers were validated in in vitro and in vivo systems.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "We live in a time of precision medicine, where more targeted diagnostics and treatments are available for individuals given their genetic make-up. Yet these options are not always utilized widely, especially among racial/ethnic minorities, such as Latinos. This is in part because of disparities that still exist in participation of Latinos in prevention and clinical trials. If we are to eliminate disparities in cancer and provide opportunities for all ethnicities to participate in precision medicine and achieve health equity, we must engage individuals impacted by the disease in research. This manuscript examines key elements for engaging Latinas in cervical cancer research and the importance of community-based participatory research to accelerate knowledge transfer from the bench side to the community. We present key concepts related to health equity and discuss the role of citizen scientists/patient advocates and promotores de salud who can help boost community participation and engagement in patient-centered research. For participatory research solutions to be effective in Latino communities, they must be based on community assets and cultural values; they must also come directly from those affected by cancer, their families, and social networks. We provide examples of how we have engaged Latinas in cervical cancer research via our Tamale Lesson and Es Tiempo campaign.

Different risk factors are associated with the disease which is classified into several intrinsic subtypes according to expression of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The advent of high throughput techniques has allowed the molecular classification of BC and development of diagnostic/prognostic tools to predict disease outcome and progression. However, most molecular classifications and diagnostic/prognostic tools were developed using samples from European/Caucasian women. Hispanic/Latino describes an admixed group of individuals with different fractions of European, African, and Indigenous American ancestries. We determined the frequency of the different intrinsic subtypes of BC in Colombia and their association with genetic ancestry and found that luminal B subtype was the most prevalent in Colombian women with BC. We found that African ancestry was associated with more aggressive forms of BC. We then used next-generation sequencing techniques to determine the underlying markers of luminal B subtype of BC in Colombia. We found 67 genes differentially expressed between luminal A and luminal B subtypes, and of those, six were common between patients with high European/low Indigenous American ancestries. Interestingly, three genes (ERBB2, MIEN1, and GRB7) form a genomic &#8220;block&#8221; in chromosome 17 from which ERBB2 and GRB7 are co-expressed. The expression of ERBB2 was independent of HER-2 labeling. Our results suggest a major role of ethnicity in the modulation of these genes in BC in Hispanic/Latina women and may be the basis for future larger studies to investigate the role of ethnicity in BC susceptibility in minority groups.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Hispanics are greatly underrepresented in the large cancer and genomic databases, and by placing all Latinos into one category, these datasets do not capture the variation in cancer determinants and outcomes that exist among Latino subgroups. Part of the solution is to include more Latinos in research, which requires improving upon the historically low Latino recruitment into cancer clinical trials. Cancer clinical trials must reflect the subpopulation that is being studied in order to capture differences among ethnic groups and to make inferences that are generalizable. There are many challenges involved in enrolling patients into clinical trials and additional barriers that must be overcome to recruit a representative number of Latinos. Recruitment programs from both the Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Mays Cancer Center at UT Health San Antonio are excellent models of program designs that enhance Hispanic accrual and address underrepresentation in clinical trials. Recommended steps to improve accrual into clinical trials are to educate physicians to better promote enrollment; build awareness among Hispanics about the role of clinical trials in improving cancer care; enhance care navigation for treatment planning including matching the right patient with the right study; develop language- and culture-appropriate educational materials; and share lessons learned among centers and investigators.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that dietary intake is a preventable risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality. However, little research has been conducted on diet and cancer in Latino groups, who have differing dietary patterns than non-Hispanic whites. Actual cancer risk statistics show differing patterns of incidence for different cancers, not only between Latinos and non-Hispanic whites, but also among Latino subgroups. Some of these differences are likely to be associated with differences in dietary patterns that exist by ethnic group, acculturation, and socioeconomic status, but more studies are needed. In particular, direct studies of diet and cancer incidence in Hispanics are lacking, and there are inadequate dietary assessment methods for these groups that measure usual intake in relation to long-term outcomes. It is estimated that about 20&#8211;42% of all cancers may be prevented by addressing preventable risk factors, including dietary intake behaviors. Although more ethnic-specific research is needed, there is sufficient evidence that improving dietary patterns in all groups will contribute to reducing cancer risk.

        "abstract": "There is a widespread recognition that health disparities impact Hispanics collectively; however, much less is known about the disease risk and outcomes with respect to the heterogeneity of Hispanic subgroups. Community-engaged approaches and strategies to research are essential for reaching these at-risk populations and building trust among community and research partners who serve and care for Hispanics. These methods are not only useful for engaging diverse populations but also useful in elucidating and differentiating nuances within and among Hispanic subgroup characteristics and their perspectives regarding participation in biomedical research. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of participatory research methods in studying, developing, and implementing culturally sensitive cancer prevention interventions and strategies among diverse racial/ethnic minority populations. Much of the previous work in this area has addressed program adaptation or cultural tailoring of existing cancer educational programs and materials. However, the adoption of community engaged research approaches in translational or transdisciplinary research are less understood and may have the potential to improve inclusion and representation of Hispanics in biomedical research studies and to shed light on how to create conditions for health and health equity.

        "abstract": "Hispanic women have a lower incidence of breast cancer and a lower population-based mortality than non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. However, Hispanics with breast cancer are younger, have more advanced disease at presentation, and are more likely to have aggressive subtypes of breast cancers (triple negative and HER2 positive) than NHW. As a result, Hispanic women with breast cancer have a higher mortality than NHW. Data show that socioeconomic factors (low SES, lack of insurance, lack of access to care) are the most significant contributors to these disparities. The greatest disparities in outcomes and mortality exist among young breast cancer subsets. We hypothesize that low SES factors and associated increased stress and poor dietary habits lead to higher incidence of childhood obesity in Hispanics. Obesity leads to increased production of serum IL-6 and other adipokines, increasing aromatase transcription; this leads to increased serum estrogen and genotoxic estrogen metabolites, contributing to higher incidence of early onset breast cancer with its worse prognosis. Recent data support this hypothesis, showing that obesity in pre-pubertal girls leads to higher serum estradiol concentrations and higher levels of genotoxic estrogen metabolites. Epidemiological data show that prolonged exposure to hormonal contraceptives leads to higher breast cancer risk, supporting the idea that a potential factor in breast carcinogenesis and breast cancer disparities is a continuum of increased exposure to estrogen from early childhood to adulthood. Thus, focusing preventive breast cancer research interventions during childhood and early adulthood in low socioeconomic neighborhoods may significantly ameliorate breast cancer disparities in Hispanics.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

Congressman Joaquin Castro, Representative from the 20th Congressional District in Bexar County, Texas, made a call to researchers to advocate for their own work with policy makers in Congress and expressed the need to increase funding for cancer research. Dr. Esteban L&#243;pez from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas spoke about understanding drivers and barriers for Latinos in cancer care. To find strategies for culturally relevant care, Blue Cross is using both published and online research to gain knowledge about what health challenges Latinos face. Dr. Robert Croyle, from the National Cancer Institute, pointed out that health disparities research has moved from documenting what is wrong to raising aspirations and goals to what is possible. Still, Latinos are underrepresented in cancer clinical trials, and one barrier to Latino accrual is the use of comorbidities as exclusion criteria. Also, NCI validates its cancer statistics by linking cancer registry data to census data; so, to support cancer research, we must support a good census. Dr. Elena Rios, President and CEO of the National Hispanic Medical Association, gave a comprehensive presentation on cancer and Latino advocacy. Some of the issues that need advocacy from the Congressional legislation in the 115th Congress include health insurance reform, research funding, CDC cancer prevention programs, Health Workforce Programs (HRSA and Department of Education), and minority health. Dr. Rios also described trends in health policy, health care, and care management and provided background for important federal strategic plans.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "title": "Breast Cancer Precision Medicine in Hispanics/Latinas: Focus on Luminal B Tumors",
        "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health defines precision medicine as &#8220;An emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person.&#8221; Without adequate representation of patient diversity, precision medicine based on data derived largely from Americans of northern European ancestry may actually exacerbate health disparities. Breast cancer is a highly prevalent, molecularly heterogeneous group of malignancies that remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Much is known about the molecular landscape of breast cancers, their mutational and gene expression profiles. Molecular tests are widely used in the clinic to estimate breast cancer risk and its recurrence in patients treated for breast cancer. However, these tests are based on studies conducted in populations that at present include very small numbers of Latinas. As of December 2018, only 37 out of 3650 molecular profiles of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas are from women who reported Hispanic/Latina ethnicity, and no race or ethnicity information is associated with a majority of the cases (2735). Hence, the clinical usefulness of molecular breast cancer tests in Latinas of different ancestry admixtures remains to be established. Patients who are identified as Hispanic/Latino are characterized by highly variable ancestry admixtures, which makes genetic and gene&#8211;environment interaction studies particularly challenging. Our group has investigated the molecular portraits of breast cancers in a cohort of Colombian women and identified a high prevalence of luminal B subtype tumors characterized by high expression of proliferation-related genes and other clinically relevant genes. Furthermore, we have uncovered clinically relevant genes whose expression is significantly associated with Native American ancestry. Additional studies are needed to validate these findings in other Hispanic/Latina populations and to examine the gene sets included in popular molecular tests.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "title": "Biomarkers and Precision Medicine in Oncology Practice and Clinical Trials",
        "abstract": "Biomarker testing, which is now often the standard of care for patients diagnosed with cancer, can be used by physicians to assess cancer risk, diagnose a particular cancer, select treatment, and/or assess treatment response. In this summary of a keynote address, Edith Perez, Professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic, discusses basic concepts and issues of biomarker-based precision medicine in clinical trials and oncology practice. She describes the general features of well-designed biomarker-driven clinical trials and offers specific suggestions for designing clinical trials to support FDA approval. Perez predicts that in the near future, tumor sequencing will become standard clinical practice; liquid biopsies will become available to sample circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); tumor classification will become molecular-based, and tumor-agnostic biomarker strategies may be used to manage patients; and clinical trials in oncology will use sequencing at both enrollment and follow-up. Additionally, she describes some basic concepts and challenges in the use of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) biomarkers, which are revolutionizing oncology. A new Program for Accelerated Cancer Therapies (PACT) was cited as an example of a multidisciplinary collaboration with NIH, NCI, and biopharma that aims to support the development of standardized biomarkers for immunoprofiling and exploratory biomarkers of high relevance to patient care. Finally, Perez explains why bringing biomarker-based trials to patients is challenging and predicts that large collaboratives such as PACT will move precision medicine and oncology forward by linking clinical retrospective and prospective cancer genomic and proteomic data with longitudinal clinical outcomes.Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "The incidence of severe mucosal damage due to low nutritional status is high in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for head and neck cancer. Objective assessments do not exist for discharge criteria after completion of CCRT. Although the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is an objective indicator of postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the prognostic impact of the PNI in patients with head and neck cancer receiving CCRT is unexplored. We investigated whether the PNI could be an objective criterion for nutritional status and a discharge criterion after completion of CCRT.We assessed the medical records of 23 patients with head and neck cancer who received triweekly cisplatin +radiotherapy (2&#8201;Gy &#215;35 fractions). We evaluated whether the PNI could be a useful evaluation indicator in patients with head and neck cancer receiving CCRT and determined the cut-off PNI value by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis as a criterion for hospital discharge.The PNI pre-treatment and post-treatment values were 51.0 and 38.0, respectively (p<0.05). The median length of hospitalisation after therapy was 5 days in patients with grades 1 and 2 and 10 days in patients with grade 3 oral and pharyngeal mucositis (p<0.05). The optimal cut-off PNI value as a criterion for hospital discharge was found to be 40.4 (grades 1 and 2 mucositis) and 38.6 (grade 3 mucositis) by the ROC analysis.The PNI is a simple, objective and temporal indicator which is useful in assessing the nutritional status of patients with head and neck cancer. The PNI could be used as an objective indicator to determine the time of discharge after CCRT completion.&#169; European Association of Hospital Pharmacists 2021. No commercial re-use.

Additionally, the authors present a case from their own experience to illustrate its complexity and unique features. Methods &#8195;A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE database using the following terminology in various combinations: meningioma , meningeal neoplasms, en plaque , skull base , spheno-orbital, and sphenoid wing . Only literature published in English between 1938 and 2018 was reviewed. All case series were specifically reviewed for sufficient data on treatment outcomes, and all literature was analyzed for reports of misdiagnosed cases. Conclusion &#8195;En plaque meningiomas may present with a variety of symptoms according to their location and degree of bone invasion, requiring a careful diagnostic and treatment approach.

The results showed that the Pediatric Units were better adapted to the needs of the adolescent and family patients and to Spanish Health Authorities recommendations: more appropriate environment, resources for education and leisure, facilities to parents and relatives. Specialized Psycosocial care by psychologists and social workers is insufficient in both cases and the compliance with national and international recommendations is weak.

Although radiation therapy has been used to treat pituitary adenomas for over a century, general trends in the usage of radiation therapy for this purpose have not been reviewed. Additionally, there are few large studies evaluating how radiation therapy is used for the treatment of these benign tumors. Investigating these trends and identifying any variations in radiation therapy utilization would help to better inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Design &#8195;Present study is a retrospective analysis of cases using the National Cancer Database. Setting &#8195;The research was organized at a tertiary academic medical center. Participants &#8195;Patients were diagnosed with pituitary adenoma between 2004 and 2014 within the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods &#8195;Temporal trends in the usage of radiation therapy to treat pituitary adenoma were analyzed through a retrospective analysis of 77,142 pituitary adenoma cases from the NCDB between 2004 and 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were to examine the relationship between patient, tumor, and treatment factors, and the incorporation of radiation therapy into the treatment of pituitary adenomas. We adjusted for potential confounders such as age, sex, race, comorbidity score, facility type, and year of diagnosis. Results &#8195;A total of 77,142 patients met inclusion criteria. Inclusion of radiation therapy in pituitary adenoma treatment was 8.0% in 2004 and steadily declined to a low of 3.1% in 2014. Overall, patients were less likely to receive radiation for their pituitary adenoma over time ( p &#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Similarly, patients were found to be less likely to receive any type of treatment for PA over time ( p &#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Multivariable evaluation found patients who were female, between 54 and 64 years of age, or treated at either a Comprehensive Community Cancer Program or an Integrated Network Cancer Program were more likely to receive radiation as part of their pituitary adenoma treatment ( p &#8201;<&#8201;0.001, odds ratio [OR]&#8201;=&#8201;2.01, confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-2.63; p &#8201;<&#8201;0.001, OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.84, CI: 1.38-2.44, respectively). Patients were less likely to receive radiation for their PA if they were African American ( p &#8201;<&#8201;0.001, OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.81, CI: 0.72-0.91). Logistic regression also identified a progressive increase in the likelihood of receiving radiation after a PA diagnosis with increasing tumor size starting with microscopic tumors, peaking at 4 to 5&#8201;cm ( p &#8201;<&#8201;0.001; OR&#8201;=&#8201;15.57; CI: 12.20-19.87). Conclusion &#8195;In this sample of pituitary adenoma patients treated at NCDB institutions between 2004 and 2014, we found a steady decline in the incorporation of radiation therapy in treatment, as well as in the use of any type of intervention for PA treatment, suggesting a rise in noninterventional observation of PA.Thieme.

        "abstract": "Background: Underreporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is common globally, and Nepal is not an exception to this. Health-care professionals (HCPs) play a vital role in reporting ADR during routine practice. Lack of knowledge and awareness about pharmacovigilance and reporting ADRs among HCPs may contribute to underreporting. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and perception of HCPs regarding ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance in a tertiary care teaching hospital in, Nepal. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. A questionnaire was distributed to 215 HCPs (medical doctors, nurses, and pharmacists) between March and September 2018. Knowledge and perception regarding ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance were studied. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). Results: The HCPs included 75 medical doctors, 126 nurses, and 14 pharmacists. Majority of the participants were female (67%), and the majority of participants were not aware of pharmacovigilance. Among the participants, pharmacists were found to have better knowledge regarding pharmacovigilance. However, other HCPs (doctors and nurses) strongly agreed about the necessity of having adequate knowledge about pharmacovigilance. Out of 215, 57.7% agreed that the important benefit of reporting ADR was to identify safe drugs and improve patient safety. The main reasons for not reporting were - ADR reporting was not widely promoted by relevant authorities (47%), followed by not knowing where and how to report ADR (34.9%). However, other HCPs (doctors and nurses) strongly agreed about the necessity of having adequate knowledge about pharmacovigilance. Conclusions: The knowledge of HCPs on ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance was poor. Despite a low knowledge of ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance among HCPs, there was a positive perception that ADR reporting is necessary and ADR monitoring system should be established in the hospital.

        "abstract": "Cancer is one of the dominant causes of death worldwide while lifelong prognosis is still inauspicious. The maturation of the cancer is seen as a process of transformation of a healthy cell into a tumor-sensitive cell, which is held entirely at the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels of the organism. Tyrosine kinases can play a major, etiologic role in the inception of malignancy and devote to the uncontrolled proliferation of cancerous cells and the progression of a tumor as well as the development of metastatic disease. Angiogenesis and oncogene activation are the major event in cell proliferation. The growth of a tumor and metastasis are fully depending on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis triggered by chemical signals from tumor cells in a phase of rapid growth. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are compounds that inhibit tyrosine kinases and effective in targeting angiogenesis and blocking the signaling pathways of oncogenes. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors like afatinib, erlotinib, crizotinib, gefitinib, and cetuximab are shown to a selective cut off tactic toward the constitutive activation of an oncogene in tumor cells, and thus contemplated as promising therapeutic approaches for the diagnosis of cancer and malignancies.&#169; Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2019.",

        "title": "CanAssist Breast Impacting Clinical Treatment Decisions in Early-Stage HR+ Breast Cancer Patients: Indian Scenario.",
        "abstract": "CanAssist Breast (CAB) has thus far been validated on a retrospective cohort of 1123 patients who are mostly Indians. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of more than 95% was observed with significant separation (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001) between low-risk and high-risk groups. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of CAB in guiding physicians to assess risk of cancer recurrence and to make informed treatment decisions for patients. Of more than 500 patients who have undergone CAB test, detailed analysis of 455 patients who were treated based on CAB-based risk predictions by more than 140 doctors across India is presented here. Majority of patients tested had node negative, T2, and grade 2 disease. Age and luminal subtypes did not affect the performance of CAB. On comparison with Adjuvant! Online (AOL), CAB categorized twice the number of patients into low risk indicating potential of overtreatment by AOL-based risk categorization. We assessed the impact of CAB testing on treatment decisions for 254 patients and observed that 92% low-risk patients were not given chemotherapy. Overall, we observed that 88% patients were either given or not given chemotherapy based on whether they were stratified as high risk or low risk for distant recurrence respectively. Based on these results, we conclude that CAB has been accepted by physicians to make treatment planning and provides a cost-effective alternative to other similar multigene prognostic tests currently available.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is no longer considered a single disease, and with better understanding of cancer biology, its management has evolved over the years, into a complex individualized use of therapeutics based on variable expressions of predictive and prognostic factors. With the advent of molecular and genetic research, the complexity and diversity of breast cancer cells and their ability to survive and develop resistance to treatment strategies became more evident. At the same time, targeted therapies evolved, as specific targets were discovered such as HER2 receptor, and androgen receptor. More recent is the development of immunotherapy which aims at strengthening the host immune system to identify and kill the tumor cells. In breast cancer treatment, use of molecular tests has been a target of controversies, due to their high costs and inaccessibility in limited resource situations. Research in breast cancer is also proceeding at a rapid pace, but it is important to remember that breast cancer continues to be a complex interplay of alterations at molecular and genetic level, with the variability in expressions at protein level leading to difference in behavior and responses to treatment and overall outcome. In the succeeding paragraphs, we will try to review the available evidence in literature and attempt to understand the molecular complexity of breast cancer in order to simplify the art of treating the disease and improving outcomes.&#169; Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2019.",

        "abstract": "This Scientific Publication reviews the information on cancer sites and mechanistic events for the more than 100 agents classified in Group&#160;1 (carcinogenic to humans) by the&#160;IARC Monographs Programme. This category of agents is diverse and includes chemicals and chemical mixtures; occupations; metals, dusts, and fibres; radiation; viruses and other biological agents; personal habits; and pharmaceuticals. For the Group 1 agents, there were cross-cutting questions about the relevance to humans of certain cancer sites or mechanistic pathways in animals. This publication is based on a systematic identification and comparison of the cancer sites observed in humans and those observed in experimental animals, and a compilation of mechanistic events for agents known to cause cancer in humans. Relevant information was analysed on all the agents classified in Group&#160;1 in&#160;Monographs&#160;up to and including Volume 109, most of which are reviewed in Volume 100A&#8211;F. A database of tumour sites seen in humans and animals was used to examine the degree of concordance by use of an anatomically based tumour classification scheme. The analysis of mechanistic aspects of the IARC Group&#160;1 agents focused on 10 key characteristics of human carcinogens developed during the course of this work. Genotoxicity was the most prevalent mechanistic characteristic, consistent with the process of carcinogenesis necessarily involving genomic changes. The IARC concordance database represents a useful source of information for comparing animal and human data with respect to the tumours caused in different species. The results of the mechanistic analysis can provide a basis for future efforts to categorize mechanistic data for carcinogens through a systematic review process. These reviews and analyses were discussed during a two-part Workshop on Tumour Site Concordance and Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis convened by IARC. This Scientific Publication is the report of that Workshop and of subsequent work by the participants, both individually and collectively. This publication also presents a statement of consensus among the Workshop participants, which summarizes the main findings and their implications for human cancer risk assessment.&#169; International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2019.

Program death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as nivolumab, fall within this class, enabling the patient's immune system to detect and destroy cancer. The introduction of ICIs is changing cancer therapy, with new drugs and new toxicities-an evolving area encountered by pharmacists.This study aims to compare the pattern of nivolumab-induced adverse events observed in practice, when compared with clinical trial and literature data. The secondary aim of the study is to identify the presentation and treatment modalities initiated in practice.We performed a retrospective case note review across 2 South Australian hospitals to identify the common toxicities and symptomatic treatments experienced by patients receiving nivolumab. Results were compared with clinical trial data from product innovator Bristol-Myer Squib and other published literature.Seventy patients were included in the study; of these, 60 (86%) experienced any grade adverse event(s). A total of 59 (84%) of 70 experienced mild to moderate grade 1 to grade 2 adverse events and 10 (14%) of 70 patients experienced severe grade 3 to grade 4 adverse events, displaying some consistencies with clinical trial and published literature data. Together, the prevalence of adverse events with details on presentation and treatments illustrates possible pharmacy practice strategies and areas for intervention.The listed prevalence of adverse events and practice strategies identified throughout this study highlights how pharmacists may assist in the identification of predictable ICI toxicities associated with gastrointestinal, endocrine, dermatological toxicities, and fatigue.",

        "title": "Lipid Formulations for Patients Requiring Parenteral Nutrition: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness, and Guidelines &#8211; An Update",
        "abstract": "Parenteral nutrition (PN) is provided through intravenous administration to patients who are unable to meet their nutritional needs either through oral intake or enteral nutrition (EN) due to pathological or surgical conditions.1&#8211;3 Decades of research have resulted in the development of relatively safe PN formulations containing amino acids, glucose, lipids (as emulsions), electrolytes, vitamins and trace elements.4 PN may be used for short or long periods of time depending on the morbidity and its severity.5 However, prolonged use of PN may be associated with increased risk of long-term adverse events including hypertriglyceridemia, infections, metabolic bone disease, and PN-associated liver disease (PNALD).5,6 The source of oil present in lipid emulsions is believed to play an important role in the development of long-term complications.6 Soybean oil (SO) is not only an excellent source of non-protein energy, but also rich in essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) and non-essential oleic acid (18:1 n-9).7 The letters &#8220;n&#8221; and &#8220;&#969;&#8221; for omega are used interchangeably. These fatty acids are precursors of longer chain fatty acids, arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3), and eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid, 20:3 n-9), respectively.8 AA and Mead acid have more proinflammatory properties than EPA.6 Prolonged use of SO emulsions in PN has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia, proinflammatory profile, and PNALD.5,6 As a result, different lipid formulations have been developed. For instance, olive oil (OO) has been added to reduce the amount of SO in lipid emulsions for PN.9 OO is the main source of lipid in the Mediterranean diet, consisting of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (18:1 n-9), phenolic compounds, and squalene.10 Diets enriched with OO have been linked to health benefits such as prevention of cancer, heart disease, and aging through its antioxidant properties.10 Compared with pure SO emulsion in PN, a mixture of 80% OO/20% SO has been shown to have some clinical benefits, despite the concern about the increase in Mead acid levels in OO enriched lipid emulsions.6 Another lipid has been used to reduce the level SO component in lipid emulsions for PN was medium chain triglycerides (MCT), containing fatty acids of 6 to 12 carbon atoms.11 Unlike long chain triglycerides (LCT) with fatty acid chains ranging from 14 to 21 carbon atoms, MCT are more water soluble and readily oxidized in the mitochondria for the production of energy.11 A mixture of 50% MCT/50% LCT has been developed and considered to be safe and tolerable in patients requiring PN.12 However, the beneficial effects of MCT/LCT compared with other lipid emulsions for PN remains unclear.6 Fish oil (FO) has lately been considered as an ideal choice of lipid to partially or completely replace SO.6 FO has a high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (20% to 40%), particularly EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3),13 which have been shown to reduce inflammation by competing with AA for eicosanoid synthesis, producing the 3-series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes and the 5-series of leukotrienes.6 Mixed-oil containing FO for use in PN such as SO/MCT/OO/FO (30%/30%/25%/15%) or MCT/SO/FO (50%/40%/10%) has been recently developed and is available for PN use.6 From small-scale clinical trials, fish oil enriched PN appears to have some clinical benefits compared with non-fish oil enriched PN.4,14 In a recent CADTH report,15 published in 2017, entitled &#8220;Lipid Formulations for Patients Requiring Parenteral Nutrition: A Review of Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness and Guidelines&#8221;, low quality evidence found no difference in comparative clinical effectiveness among lipid emulsions examined in preterm infants. There was some evidence that fish oil enriched PN had some clinical benefits in non-surgical and surgical adult patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Economic evaluations from low-quality studies showed that FO emulsion was more cost-effective than SO-based emulsions. None of the identified guidelines could make strong recommendations regarding the type of lipid emulsions for PN due to insufficient evidence. The aim of this report is to update the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines on the use of lipid formulations for patients requiring PN.Copyright &#169; 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.",

Here we report the use of droplet microfluidics for the simple and highly reproducible synthesis of cadmium sulfide (CdS) and cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs without the use of harsh solvents and in ambient conditions. Our approach uses a liquid-liquid barrier between two immiscible liquids to generate a digital droplet reactor. This reaction droplet is easily controlled and manipulated and offers enhanced mixing when coupled to a helical mixer, resulting in a significant reduction in size distribution compared to benchtop procedures. Furthermore, QD characteristics have modeled and predicted based on the parameters of the microfluidic device.

        "abstract": "Localizing and characterizing clinically-significant lung nodules, a potential precursor to lung cancer, at the lowest achievable radiation dose is demanded to minimize the stochastic radiation effects from x-ray computed tomography (CT). A minimal dose level is heavily dependent on the image reconstruction algorithms and clinical task, in which the tissue texture always plays an important role. This study aims to investigate the dependence through a task-based evaluation at multiple dose levels and variable textures in reconstructions with prospective patient studies. 133 patients with a suspicious pulmonary nodule scheduled for biopsy were recruited and the data was acquired at120kVp with three different dose levels of 100, 40 and 20mAs. Three reconstruction algorithms were implemented: analytical filtered back-projection (FBP) with optimal noise filtering; statistical Markov random field (MRF) model with optimal Huber weighting (MRF-H) for piecewise smooth reconstruction; and tissue-specific texture model (MRF-T) for texture preserved statistical reconstruction. Experienced thoracic radiologists reviewed and scored all images at random, blind to the CT dose and reconstruction algorithms. The radiologists identified the nodules in each image including the 133 biopsy target nodules and 66 other non-target nodules. For target nodule characterization, only MRF-T at 40mAs showed no statistically significant difference from FBP at 100mAs. For localizing both the target nodules and the non-target nodules, some as small as 3mm, MRF-T at 40 and 20mAs levels showed no statistically significant difference from FBP at 100mAs, respectively. MRF-H and FBP at 40 and 20mAs levels performed statistically differently from FBP at 100mAs. This investigation concluded that (1) the textures in the MRF-T reconstructions improves both the tasks of localizing and characterizing nodules at low dose CT and (2) the task of characterizing nodules is more challenging than the task of localizing nodules and needs more dose or enhanced textures from reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common form of brain tumor and has a uniformly poor prognosis. Development of prognostic biomarkers in easily accessible serum samples have the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with GBM through personalized therapy planning.In this study pre-treatment serum samples from 30 patients newly diagnosed with GBM were evaluated using a 40-protein multiplex ELISA platform. Analysis of potentially relevant gene targets using The Cancer Genome Atlas database was done using the Glioblastoma Bio Discovery Portal (GBM-BioDP). A ten-biomarker subgroup of clinically relevant molecules was selected using a functional grouping analysis of the 40 plex genes with two genes selected from each group on the basis of degree of variance, lack of co-linearity with other biomarkers and clinical interest. A Multivariate Cox proportional hazard approach was used to analyze the relationship between overall survival (OS), gene expression, and resection status as covariates.Thirty of 40 of the MSD molecules mapped to known genes within TCGA and separated the patient cohort into two main clusters centered predominantly around a grouping of classical and proneural versus the mesenchymal subtype as classified by Verhaak. Using the values for the 30 proteins in a prognostic index (PI) demonstrated that patients in the entire cohort with a PI below the median lived longer than those patients with a PI above the median (HR 1.8, p=0.001) even when stratified by both age and MGMT status. This finding was also consistent within each Verhaak subclass and highly significant (range p=0.0001-0.011). Additionally, a subset of ten proteins including, CRP, SAA, VCAM1, VEGF, MDC, TNFA, IL7, IL8, IL10, IL16 were found to have prognostic value within the TCGA database and a positive correlation with overall survival in GBM patients who had received gross tumor resection followed by conventional radiation therapy and temozolomide treatment concurrent with the addition of valproic acid.These findings demonstrate that proteomic approaches to the development of prognostic assays for treatment of GBM may hold potential clinical value.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: As both the number of cancer survivors and the length of survival time are increasing, long-term health issues related to cancer and its treatment are becoming more prevalent. Research suggests that exercise can mitigate several negative health consequences in cancer survivors and improve physical function and quality of life. Multi-modal exercise interventions have been proposed as a cornerstone for survivorship care. However, studies evaluating exercise programmes within the Irish population are lacking. Purpose: To evaluate the introduction, implementation and acceptability of a multi-modal exercise rehabilitation programme for deconditioned cancer survivors in a real-world, standard practice setting. Methods and analysis: In this single-arm prospective feasibility study, cancer survivors (n=40) will undergo a 10-week multi-modal exercise programme. The study population will comprise of cancer survivors attending outpatient services in an Irish national cancer centre. Participants will be aged 18 or older and have completed treatment with curative intent. Feasibility will be evaluated in terms of recruitment, adherence and compliance to the programme. Secondary outcomes will examine physical function and quality of life measures. In addition, the acceptability of the programme will be assessed through stakeholder feedback. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval through the St. James's Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital Research and Ethics Committee is currently pending. The study results will be used to optimise the intervention content and may serve as the foundation for a larger definitive trial. Results will be disseminated through peer-review journals, congresses and relevant clinical groups.

        "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming and cellular plasticity drive tumorigenesis. However, how these cellular events collectively contribute to the oncogenic process is poorly understood. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental mechanism of cellular plasticity, is governed by the EMT transcription repressors such as Snail. In the present study, through establishment and characterization of inducible overexpression of Snail in A549 lung cancer cells, we aim to define the metabolic reprogramming in response to Snail in the EMT of lung cancer cells.Our metabolomic analysis suggests that forced expression of Snail accompanied reduced diversion of glycolytic metabolites to the serine/glycine metabolic shunt, a critical metabolic branch that distributes glucose catabolic intermediates to the major anabolic pathways. Our gene expression profiling and molecular characterization revealed that Snail actively suppressed the expression of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), a key enzyme on the serine/glycine metabolic shunt, through binding to an evolutionarily conserved E-box motif and thereby inhibiting the promoter of the GLDC gene. Besides, knockdown of GLDC led to a cellular function shift from proliferation to migration.This study has revealed a novel molecular link that integrates the serine/glycine metabolism with the Snail-mediated EMT program in cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the Bcl2, P53 and apoptosis changes against skin cancer in experimental animals. Skin cancer is the most common form of human cancer. It is estimated that over 1 million new cases occur annually. The annual rates of all forms of skin cancer are increasing each year, representing a growing public concern. It has also been estimated that nearly half of all Americans who live to age 65 are likely to develop skin cancer at least once. Skin cancer was induced in rats by Di Methyl Benz (a) Anthracene at the dosage of DMBA (5&#160;&#181;g) per animal, three times a week for 28&#160;weeks after conformation of skin cancer treated with Paclitaxel and Di allyl sulfide for 30&#160;days. The levels of Bcl2 gene expression were significantly decreased and P53gene expression were markedly increased in Paclitaxel and Di allyl sulfide treated animals when compared with cancer bearing animals. The treatment with combination of Paclitaxel and Di allyl sulfide effectively reduced Bcl2 protein expression and also increased P53gene expression. Moreover, the levels of Bcl2 and P53 a good indicators of restoring the skin architecture, were also reversed in skin damage subjects after treatment with the herbal&#160;compounds preparation. So, from the obtained results it is concluded that a combination of Paclitaxel and Di allyl sulfide is capable of restoring the skin architecture and can also increase the apoptosis activities in skin cancer rats.&#169; Association of Clinical Biochemists of India 2019.",

        "title": "A Bayesian transition model for missing longitudinal binary outcomes and an application to a smoking cessation study.",
        "abstract": "Smoking cessation intervention studies often produce data on smoking status at discrete follow-up assessments, often with missing data in different amounts at each assessment. Smoking status in these studies is a dynamic process with individuals transitioning from smoking to abstinent, as well as abstinent to smoking, at different times during the intervention. Directly assessing transitions provides an opportunity to answer important questions like 'Does the proposed intervention help smokers remain abstinent or quit smoking more effectively than other interventions?' In this article, we model changes in smoking status and examine how interventions and other covariates affect the transitions. We propose a Bayesian approach for fitting the transition model to the observed data and impute missing outcomes based on a logistic model, which accounts for both missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) mechanisms. The proposed Bayesian approach treats missing data as additional unknown quantities and samples them from their posterior distributions. The performance of the proposed method is investigated through simulation studies and illustrated by data from a randomized controlled trial of smoking cessation interventions. Finally, posterior predictive checking and log pseudo marginal likelihood (LPML) are used to assess model assumptions and perform model comparisons, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Although many observational studies have shown an association between plasma homocysteine levels and cardiovascular diseases, controversy remains. In this study, we estimated the role of increased plasma homocysteine levels on the etiology of coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction.A two-sample Mendelian randomization study on disease was conducted, i.e. \"coronary heart disease\" (n&#8201;=&#8201;184,305) and \"acute myocardial infarction\" (n&#8201;=&#8201;181,875). Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were genome-wide significantly associated with plasma homocysteine levels in 57,644 subjects from the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) consortium genome-wide association study and were known to be associated at p&#8201;<&#8201;5&#215;10-8, were used as an instrumental variable.None of the nine single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (p&#8201;>&#8201;0.05 for all). Mendelian randomization analysis revealed no causal effects of plasma homocysteine levels, either on coronary heart disease (inverse variance weighted; odds ratio&#8201;=&#8201;1.015, 95% confidence interval&#8201;=&#8201;0.923-1.106, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.752) or on acute myocardial infarction (inverse variance weighted; odds ratio&#8201;=&#8201;1.037, 95% confidence interval&#8201;=&#8201;0.932-1.142, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.499). The results were consistent in sensitivity analyses using the weighted median and Mendelian randomization-Egger methods, and no directional pleiotropy (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.213 for coronary heart disease and p&#8201;=&#8201;0.343 for acute myocardial infarction) was observed. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that plasma homocysteine levels were not significantly associated with coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction.The findings from this Mendelian randomization study indicate no causal relationship between plasma homocysteine levels and coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction. Conflicting findings from observational studies might have resulted from residual confounding or reverse causation.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

        "title": "Retrospective Analysis of Clinical Outcomes Associated With the Use of Pegfilgrastim On-body Injector in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Requiring Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Support.",
        "abstract": "Objectives: Pegfilgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used as primary prophylaxis in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens that have greater than 20% risk of developing febrile neutropenia (FN). Historically, pegfilgrastim has been administered 24 to 72 hours after chemotherapy, necessitating a return to clinic to receive the provider-administered injection. An alternative option is the pegfilgrastim on-body injector (OBI). With the OBI device, patients have their pegfilgrastim administered 27 hours after receiving chemotherapy while remaining at home, avoiding an additional clinic appointment. Concerns with pegfilgrastim OBI include lack of experience with the device in both the patient and provider, device-related failures, and the success of delivery. This study evaluates pegfilgrastim OBI failure rates through associated patient outcomes among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy requiring G-CSF. Methods: A retrospective electronic chart review was conducted of adult patients with cancer who received chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim OBI from July 1, 2016, to July 31, 2018. The primary objective of this study was the incidence of FN in patients receiving pegfilgrastim OBI. Results: There were no reported cases of hospitalization due to FN in patients who received pegfilgrastim OBI. Dose delays and dosage modifications were not observed in our review. The OBI device failure rate was found to be low (1.92%). Conclusion: The low device failure rate from this study suggests that the OBI is a viable option for administration of pegfilgrastim in patients receiving chemotherapy requiring G-CSF.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

There are limited number of population-based studies that examine this modern evolution. Here, we describe the trends of management of intracranial meningiomas using a national database. Methods &#8195;The data were obtained from the National Cancer Database for the years 2004 to 2015, the collected variables included: patients' age, gender, insurance type, income, comorbidity score, the tumor size and grade, and treatment modality (observation, surgery, radiotherapy, or combination therapy). We performed statistical analyses to detect association between unique variables and outcomes. In addition, we performed mortality analyses for various treatment modalities. Results &#8195;A total of 199,096 patients with a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma were included, the majority of patients were white females, mean age of 61 years, and half of the tumors were &#8804; 3&#8201;cm. Observation was the most commonly used management modality followed by surgical resection, radiotherapy, and combination therapy. For the entire time period, there was an increased use of observation as a primary management method. Predictors of mortality included increased age, larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, treatment at a community hospital, and higher comorbidity scores. Conclusion &#8195;Population-based studies of intracranial meningiomas are uncommon; our study is one of the few reports that examine the changes in the modern management paradigms of meningioma in the United States over time.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new dimension reduction algorithm based on low-dimension ordered orthogonal projection (LOOP), which is used for cancer detection with terahertz (THz) images of freshly excised human breast cancer tissues. A THz image can be represented by a data cube with each pixel containing a high dimension spectrum vector covering several THz frequencies, where each frequency represents a different dimension in the vector. The proposed algorithm projects the high-dimension spectrum vector of each pixel within the THz image into a low-dimension subspace that contains the majority of the unique features embedded in the image. The low-dimension subspace is constructed by sequentially identifying its orthonormal basis vectors, such that each newly chosen basis vector represents the most unique information not contained by existing basis vectors. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to represent the statistical distributions of the low-dimension feature vectors obtained from the proposed dimension reduction algorithm. The model parameters are iteratively learned by using unsupervised learning methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or expectation maximization, and the results are used to classify the various regions within a tumor sample. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves apparent performance improvement in human breast cancer tissue over existing approaches such as one-dimension Markov chain Monte Carlo. The results confirm that the dimension reduction algorithm presented in this paper is a promising technique for breast cancer detection with THz images, and the classification results present a good correlation with respect to the histopathology results of the analyzed samples.",

We review the main statistical methods for evaluating surrogate markers. In addition, we suggest a new measure, the so-called \"population surrogacy fraction of treatment effect,\" or simply the p-measure, in the setting of clinical trials. The p-measure carries an appealing population impact interpretation and supplements the existing statistical measures of surrogacy by providing \"absolute\" information. We apply the new measure along with other prominent measures to the HIV Prevention Trial Network 052 Study, a landmark trial for HIV/AIDS treatment-as-prevention.",

The dogs were equally likely to approach speakers projecting rattling as they were to approach speakers playing control sounds, or speakers that were silent. Furthermore, the dogs spent no less time in front of the speakers projecting the rattles than they did in front of speakers projecting control sounds or no sound. The dogs' reactions may not be representative of other species with whom rattlesnakes come into contact, but the data suggest a need for some circumspection about the role of rattling in the rattlesnake's defensive repertoire. Our results also suggest that dogs may be vulnerable to envenomation because they fail to react to the sound of rattling with avoidance.",

The isolates produced butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate but there were specific differences including production of formate and propionate. Together, these data indicate that UPII 199-6T, KA00182T and BV3C16-1T represent novel species within the genus Megasphaera. We propose the following names: Megasphaera lornae sp. nov. for UPII 199-6T representing the type strain of this species (=DSM 111201T=ATCC TSD-205T), Megasphaera hutchinsoni sp. nov. for KA00182T representing the type strain of this species (=DSM 111202T=ATCC TSD-206T) and Megasphaera vaginalis sp. nov. for BV3C16-1T representing the type strain of this species (=DSM 111203T=ATCC TSD-207T).",

        "abstract": "Cabazitaxel prolongs survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the postdocetaxel setting. We investigate the benefit of continuing cabazitaxel beyond 10 cycles in patients who are clinically responding without significant toxicity.A comparison was made between patients who received cabazitaxel for >10 cycles and those who had &#8804;10 cycles. Overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) changes and treatment-associated adverse events were evaluated.The median OS was 9 months (range 0.75-59), with OS significantly higher in patients who received extended duration of treatment: 14 months (range 3-90) vs 7 months (range 1.3-21) in patients treated with 4-10 cycles (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.74, p=0.01). PSA decline did not show a significant correlation with OS (PSA decline &#8805;50%, p=0.54). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in OS between patients who had a normal versus high ALP at baseline. There was no clear evidence of cumulative toxicity in those having >10 cycles.A substantial proportion of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were able to receive more than 10 cycles of cabazitaxel without clinically relevant cumulative toxicity.&#169; European Association of Hospital Pharmacists 2021.

The functional improvement in the form of speech and swallowing was evaluated postoperatively.The flap was successfully taken in all patients except for marginal or tip loss. This is a locally available flap with minimal operating time and does not require microvascular skills.

Due to the rarity of these tumours, it is the practicing oral pathologists' accountability to confirm some of these neoplasms with or without special investigative modalities to rule out the differential diagnosis histopathologically. One in the group of such tumour prevails haemangiopericytoma aka. solitary fibrous tumour (HPC/SFT). The management of these tumours is purely histopathologically driven, since the surgical procedure is dependent on the histological diagnosis. This neoplasm is histologically very difficult to confirm as benign or malignant without the use of immunohistochemical markers.

        "abstract": "To conduct a meta-analysis assessing the perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes of partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN) for T1b tumours. The primary endpoints were the oncological outcomes. The secondary endpoints were the perioperative and functional outcomes.A systematic literature review was performed by searching multiple databases through February 2019 to identify eligible comparative studies according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Identified reports were assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized controlled trials.Overall, 13 retrospective cohort studies were included in the analysis. Patients undergoing PN were younger (weighted mean difference [WMD] -3.49 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.16 to -1.82; p<0.0001) and had smaller masses (WMD -0.45&#160;cm, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.31; p<0.0001). There were no differences in the oncological outcome, which was demonstrated by progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; p=0.22), cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.91; p=0.57) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.01; p=0.96). The two procedures were similar in estimated blood loss (WMD -16.47&#160;mL; p=0.53) and postoperative complications (risk ratio [RR] 1.32; p=0.10), and PN provided better renal function preservation and was related to a lower likelihood of chronic kidney disease onset (RR 0.38; p=0.006).PN is an effective treatment for T1b tumours because it offers similar surgical morbidity, equivalent cancer control, and better renal preservation compared to RN.&#169; 2021 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

It promotes mucus clearance without generating any pressure gradient, allowing patients to breathe at tidal volume against no resistance.Pilot randomized controlled study.Tertiary hospital.Fifty adult patients who underwent lung cancer lobectomy were randomized to undergo chest physiotherapy with EFA (n=26) or PEP (n=24).EFA; PEP bottle.Incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) and length of stay.trends in inspiratory capacity, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and dyspnoea. Patients rated user-friendliness of the two devices on a 5-point Likert scale.A slightly different incidence of PPCs was observed between the EFA and PEP group. Nevertheless, the length of stay was similar in the two groups. No substantial differences were seen in trends of inspiratory capacity, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnoea between the two groups. Patient-reported user-friendliness of the two devices did not differ significantly, although the use of the EFA device appeared less strenuous.Results of this pilot study point to the use of EFA as an alternative treatment option rather than as a replacement for the PEP bottle in chest physiotherapy following lung cancer lobectomy. EFA may be preferable for weaker patients and/or with airway leakages in whom PEP has limited indications. Further investigation in a larger sample is required to statistically confirm the findings.

        "abstract": "Collective cell polarization and alignment play important roles in tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer metastasis. How cells sense the direction and position in these processes, however, has not been fully understood. Here we construct a theoretical model based on describing cell layer as a nemato-elastic medium, by which the cell polarization, cell alignment and cell active contraction are explicitly expressed as functions of components of the nematic order parameter. To determine the order parameter we derive two sets of governing equations, one for the force equilibrium of the system, and the other for the minimization of the system's free energy including the energy of cell polarization and alignment. By solving these coupled governing equations, we can predict the effects of substrate stiffness, geometries of cell layers, external forces and myosin activity on the direction- and position-dependent cell aspect ratio and cell orientation. Moreover, the axisymmetric problem with cells on a ring-like pattern is solved analytically, and the analytical solution for cell aspect ratio are governed by parameter groups which include the stiffness of the cell and the substrate, the strength of myosin activity and the external forces. Our predictions of the cell aspect ratio and orientation are generally comparable to experimental observations. These results show that the pattern of cell polarization is determined by the anisotropic degree of active contractile stress, and suggest a stress-driven polarization mechanism that enables cells to sense their spatial positions to develop direction- and position-dependent behavior. This, in turn, sheds light on the ways to control pattern formation in tissue engineering for potential biomedical applications.",

Unfortunately, the inadequacy and quality of the biopsy samples are the major obstacles in molecular testing of EGFR mutation in lung cancer. To address this issue, the present study intended to use liquid biopsy as the non-invasive method for EGFR mutation detection. A total of 31 patients with an advanced stage of lung cancer were enrolled in the study from which cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and FFPE tissue DNA was extracted. Extracted DNA samples were analyzed for further EGFR exon specific mutation analysis by ARMS-PCR. Data were analyzed statistically using SPSS software. In cfDNA samples, the prevalence of wild type EGFR was 48% while the prevalence of TKI resistant and TKI sensitive mutations were 3%. Conversely, in tissue DNA samples, the prevalence of wild type, TKI sensitive and TKI resistant mutations were 48%, 19%, and 3%, respectively. The overall concordance of EGFR mutation between cfDNA and tissue DNA was 83%. McNemar's test revealed that there was no significant difference between EGFR expression of cfDNA and tissue DNA samples. Additionally, the significant-high incidence of TKI resistant mutations was observed in tobacco habituates, indicating the role of carcinogens present in the tobacco in developing resistant mutations.

        "abstract": "Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) imposes a trade-off between non-invasive access and surgical capability. Treatment of early gastric cancers over 20 mm in diameter can be achieved by performing Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) with a flexible endoscope; however, this procedure is technically challenging, suffers from extended operation times and requires extensive training. To facilitate the ESD procedure, we have created a deployable cable driven robot that increases the surgical capabilities of the flexible endoscope while attempting to minimize the impact on the access that they offer. Using a low-profile inflatable support structure in the shape of a hollow hexagonal prism, our robot can fold around the flexible endoscope and, when the target site has been reached, achieve a 73.16% increase in volume and increase its radial stiffness. A sheath around the variable stiffness structure delivers a series of force transmission cables that connect to two independent tubular end-effectors through which standard flexible endoscopic instruments can pass and be anchored. Using a simple control scheme based on the length of each cable, the pose of the two instruments can be controlled by haptic controllers in each hand of the user. The forces exerted by a single instrument were measured, and a maximum magnitude of 8.29 N observed along a single axis. The working channels and tip control of the flexible endoscope remain in use in conjunction with our robot and were used during a procedure imitating the demands of ESD was successfully carried out by a novice user. Not only does this robot facilitate difficult surgical techniques, but it can be easily customized and rapidly produced at low cost due to a programmatic design approach.Copyright &#169; 2020 Runciman, Avery, Zhao, Darzi and Mylonas.",

        "abstract": "Personalized medicine asks if a new treatment will help a particular patient, rather than if it improves the average response in a population. Without a causal model to distinguish these questions, interpretational mistakes arise. These mistakes are seen in an article by Demidenko [2016] that recommends the \"D-value,\" which is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the new-treatment group has a higher value for the outcome than a randomly chosen person from the control-treatment group. The abstract states \"The D-value has a clear interpretation as the proportion of patients who get worse after the treatment\" with similar assertions appearing later. We show these statements are incorrect because they require assumptions about the potential outcomes which are neither testable in randomized experiments nor plausible in general. The D-value will not equal the proportion of patients who get worse after treatment if (as expected) those outcomes are correlated. Independence of potential outcomes is unrealistic and eliminates any personalized treatment effects; with dependence, the D-value can even imply treatment is better than control even though most patients are harmed by the treatment. Thus, D-values are misleading for personalized medicine. To prevent misunderstandings, we advise incorporating causal models into basic statistics education.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Early-activated RAS/RAF mutation status is a key molecular finding in colorectal cancer (CRC), while these mutations have been proposed as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. The present study has been designed as a longitudinal study to evaluate and summarize the different genotypes of metastatic CRC (mCRC), and assessing any association with the disease prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics. This study was performed in two main referral hospitals of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, over three years (2016-2018). Methods: Mutations were detected by Idylla tests of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF among a total of 173 mCRCs, using surgically-resected specimens or biopsied samples. To evaluate the factors associated with overall survival (OS) and prognosis, the Cox proportional hazards model was used in two steps to estimate the outcome measures (hazard ratio, or HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The nominal 1 to 5-year OS rates were 78%, 65%, 55%, 46%, and 42%, respectively. KRAS mutations in codon 12 was an independent significant prognostic factor, as the patients with codon 12 mutations had a significantly lower OS (P Log-rank=0.049) and a higher hazard of mortality (HR=2.30; 95% CI: 0.95-5.58; P =0.066). Also, the mCRC patients with liver metastasis (HR=2.49; 95% CI: 1.49-12.52; P =0.002) and tumors of the distal colon (HR=3.36; 95% CI: 1.07-10.49; P =0.037) had a significantly worse prognosis. Conclusion: KRAS mutation in codon 12 was an independent significant poor prognostic factor, and patients with liver metastasis had a significantly worse prognosis. Routinely performing specific oncogenic tests may help improve the patients' prognosis and life expectancy.&#169; 2021 The Author(s).",

The micropore Fe-MOF was used as MRI agents for locating tumors and as nanocarriers to upload chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, MOF showed excellent targeting performance under different administration including intravenous injection for breast cancer and local instillation for bladder cancer. Notably, when irradiated with an 808 nm laser, the agent demonstrates the high efficacy of photothermal therapy and heat release efficiency of the drug around the tumor site. This combination therapy provides an alternative drug administration method and can be adapted to a series of cancer cell types and molecular targets associated with disease progression.",

Here, we report the development of rationally designed antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) that can selectively recognize and attack breast tumor-associated endothelial cells (BTECs), while sparing normal endothelial cells (NECs). We first performed a quantitative and unbiased screening of a panel of cancer-related antigens on human BTECs and identified CD105 as the optimal ADC target on these cells. We then used clinically approved ADC linkers and cytotoxic drugs to engineer two CD105-targeted ADCs: CD105-DM1 and CD105-MMAE and evaluated their in vitro efficacy in human BTECs and NECs. We found that both CD105-DM1 and CD105-MMAE exhibited highly potent and selective cytotoxicity against BTECs with IC50 values of 3.2 and 3.7 nM, respectively, significantly lower than their IC50 values on NECs (8-13 fold). Our proof-of-principle study suggests that CD105-targeted ADCs are promising antiangiogenic agents that have the potential to be used to inhibit the established tumor vasculature of breast tumors in a safe and precise manner.",

        "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) has been widely used for the treatment of various cancers, however, the use of soluble DOX is limited by its low therapeutic index and improved formulations are therefore sought. Aside from its tumoricidal properties, DOX has also been shown to cause an immunogenic form of cell death, however, it is becoming abundantly clear that in situ immune stimulation alone is insufficient to cause significant immune based antitumor activity and that immune checkpoint modulation is also required. In this study, DOX-loaded nanoparticles were made by nanoprecipitation of DOX with a PEGylated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (DOX-PLGA-PEG NPs) and were then tested in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (antiprogrammed death (anti-PD-1)) in a murine melanoma model to enhance antitumor effectiveness. Results showed the prepared particles to be approximately 134 nm in diameter (zeta potential -22 mV) with a loading of 1.75 &#956;g DOX/mg NPs. In vitro release studies (of DOX) revealed the NPs to exhibit a 12 h burst release phase, followed by a slower release phase for up to 200 h. Survival studies of mice challenged with B16.F10 melanoma cells, revealed 60% of mice treated with the combination of DOX-PLGA-PEG NPs plus anti-PD-1 were tumor-free at the completion of the study. This combination therapy demonstrated higher antitumor efficacy in vivo compared to control, soluble DOX, and monotherapy of DOX-PLGA-PEG NPs or anti-PD-1 solution (p < 0.05). Moreover, in vivo safety studies (mouse weight/histopathological/toxicity) were investigated and results suggested that the combination therapy was safe. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the successful fabrication of DOX-loaded NPs by a nanoprecipitation method, and when combined with checkpoint inhibition could provide significant therapy in a murine melanoma model, suggesting that the DOX-PLGA-PEG NPs may be generating immune stimulation in situ and that benefit from this combination may be obtained in a clinical setting in the future.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer shows a high affinity toward bone, causing bone-related complications, leading to a poor clinical prognosis. The Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway has been well-documented for the bone regenerative process; however, the regulation of the Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathway in breast cancer bone metastasis is poorly explored. Here, we report that the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway has a significant effect on osteogenesis during breast cancer bone metastasis. In this study, we have created a 3D in vitro breast cancer bone metastatic microenvironment using nanoclay-based scaffolds along with osteogenically differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The results showed upregulation in expressions of Wnt-related factors (Wnt-5a, &#946;-catenin, AXIN2, and LRP5) in sequential cultures of MSCs with MCF-7 as compared to sequential cultures of MSCs with MDA-MB-231. Sequential cultures of MSCs with MCF-7 also showed higher &#946;-catenin expression on the protein levels than sequential cultures of MSCs with MDA-MB-231. Stimulation of Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling in sequential cultures of MSCs with MCF-7 by ET-1 resulted in increased bone formation, whereas inactivation of Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling by DKK-1 displayed a significant decrease in bone formation, mimicking bone lesions in breast cancer patients. These data collectively demonstrate that Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling governs osteogenesis within the tumor-harboring bone microenvironment, leading to bone metastasis.

DOX-cRGD-sPLGA XNPs with a cRGD surface density of 48% exhibited the best cellular uptake in &#945;v&#946;3 overexpressing B16F10 cells and delivered DOX into the cell nuclei after 6 h of incubation, in contrast to nontargeted DOX-sPLGA XNPs that delivered DOX mainly in the cytoplasm. Cell viability experiments showed that DOX-cRGD-sPLGA XNPs had about 2-fold better inhibitory activity in B16F10 cells than nontargeted DOX-sPLGA XNPs. Interestingly, DOX-cRGD-sPLGA XNPs achieved a great melanoma accumulation of 10.96% ID/g and significantly better suppression of B16F10 melanoma than DOX-sPLGA XNPs and Lipo-DOX. DOX-cRGD-sPLGA XNPs brought about marked improvement of the survival rate of B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice at 20 mg of DOX equiv/kg. Smart nanotherapeutics based on the star PLGA-lipoic acid conjugate have emerged as an appealing nanoplatform for targeted tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "The strategy of co-loading therapeutic agents in a single nanocarrier is the most common method in theranostic cancer research. However, it is still challenging to encapsulate theranostic agents that have different physicochemical properties in a single nanocarrier system because of the immiscibility between the hydrophobic fluorescent molecule and the hydrophilic drug molecule. Thus, we report a novel concept of a theranostic nanoparticle (NP) consisting of an amphiphilic near-infrared (NIR) dye as a hydrophilic drug delivery carrier with enhanced NIR imaging capability. Unlike conventional nanocarrier systems, the newly designed amphiphilic NIR dyes (Cy-C dyes) function as both the drug delivery carrier and the fluorescent imaging agent. It can be utilized for therapy and diagnosis simultaneously by simply encapsulating the hydrophilic drug. This method is innovative not only due to formation of the theranostic nanoparticle for immiscible hydrophilic drug delivery but also because of generation of strong fluorescence signals due to the Cy-C dyes on the surfaces of the NPs. In this study, Cy-C (C = C3, C6, and C9) dyes were designed by conjugating the heptamethine cyanine dye with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG5K) and polyethyleneimine 2000 (PEI2K). The result was self-assembled structures that effectively encapsulated a hydrophilic drug molecule (MTX) without self-quenching and scattered light interference. Among the Cy-C NPs encapsulating MTX (Cy-C/MTX NPs), Cy-C6/MTX and Cy-C9/MTX formed a concentric supramolecular bilayer (like liposomes in aqueous solution) and were capable of translocating hydrophilic drug molecules to their aqueous interior spaces. The supramolecular bilayer structure of Cy-C9/MTX provides better particle stability and drug delivery efficacy than does the supramolecular monolayer structure of Cy-C3/MTX. In addition, Cy-C9/MTX demonstrated excellent blood circulation and long-term tumor retention qualities in living mice. The effective tumor suppression ability of Cy-C9/MTX validated the concept that the amphiphilic Cy-C9 dye is the best nanoplatform for theranostics based on hydrophilic drug delivery.",

Hence, in this research, we designed and synthesized a series of tumor targeting and redox-responsive gold nanoparticles conjugated with three kinds of functional polypeptides (AuNPPs) that consisted of targeting peptide GE11, cell-penetrating peptide octaarginine (R8), and polyhistidine. All the AuNPPs exhibited superior cancer cellular internalization ability and targeting gene transfection efficiency compared with commercial agent BPEI 25K. It is interesting to find that different relative positions of GE11 and R8 can cause the change of target ability and gene transfection efficiency, and the suitable relative position of R8 and GE11 can not only endow the gene vector with functions that peptides previously own but also bring the synergistic effects. The best-performed AuNPP6-1 was chosen to transport the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-shRNA into A549 tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice, and in vivo fluorescence imaging showed AuNPP6-1 mainly accumulated in tumor sites and achieved a great targeting therapy effect.

To study the effects of microenvironmental elements on Ewing's sarcoma (ES) pathogenesis, we tissue-engineered an acellular three-dimensional (3D) bone tumor niche from electrospun poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds that incorporate bone-like architecture, extracellular matrix (ECM), and mineralization. PCL-ECM constructs were generated by decellularizing PCL scaffolds harboring cultures of osteogenic human mesenchymal stem cells. The PCL-ECM constructs simulated in vivo-like tumor architecture and increased the proliferation of ES cells compared to PCL scaffolds alone. Compared to monolayer controls, 3D environments facilitated the downregulation of the canonical insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signal cascade through mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), both of which are targets of recent clinical trials. In addition to the downregulation of canonical IGF-1R signaling, 3D environments promoted a reduction in the clathrin-dependent nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of IGF-1R. In vitro drug testing revealed that 3D environments generated cell phenotypes that were resistant to mTOR inhibition and chemotherapy. Our versatile PCL-ECM constructs allow for the investigation of the roles of various microenvironmental elements in ES tumor growth, cancer cell morphology, and induction of resistant cell phenotypes.",

In this manuscript, a multifunctional nanomedicine (denoted as ZDCMH NP), combining multiple TME destruction strategies into one delivery system, has been designed and fabricated. In brief, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc, a photosensitizer), bromopentacarbonylmanganese(I) (COMn, a CO donor), and losartan (Dup, a CAF inhibitor) were coloaded inside mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). After that, a cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) gel shell was encapsulated onto the surface of the MSNs to form ZDCMH NPs. After arriving at the tumor tissue, the HA gel shell could be degraded by hyaluronidase (HAase) in the ECM to trigger encapsulated drug release. After light irradiation, ZnPc generated abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could provide photodynamic therapy (PDT) activity and induce COMn to release CO, which could improve the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to promote ZDCMH NP accumulation in tumor tissue. The released Dup could inhibit CAF activity and downregulate the collagen fiber concentration in the TME to promote the deep penetration of ZDCMH NPs inside solid tumors. In vitro and in vivo anticancer studies have indicated that the destruction of the TME by multiple strategies is very helpful for ZnPc to obtain satisfactory PDT efficiency.",

Reducing cortical membrane tension by cytoskeleton inhibitors (cytochalasin D and nocodazole) or osmotic regulators (sucrose, polyethylene glycol, and nonionic surfactants) attenuated the RHA toxicity. The selective toxicity of RHA toward human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells over healthy blood cells suggests a potential therapy for blood cancer.

There have been reports of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), silver salts, and Prussian blue (PB) being used for medicinal purposes which are clinically approved. In this context, in the present communication, we incorporated PB and silver salts (silver nitrate) to develop silver PB analogue nanoparticles (SPBANPs), a new nanomedicine formulation as a safer and effective mode of treatment strategy (2-in-1) for both cancer and bacterial infections. Considering all fundamental issues of nanomedicine, along with understanding of the biological impact of PB, we designed a simple, fast, efficient, cheap, and eco-friendly method for the synthesis of [poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)]-stabilized silver hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (silver PB analogue: Ag3[Fe(CN)6] abbreviated as SPBANPs). Various analytical tools were used to analyze and characterize the nanomaterials (SPBANPs). The SPBANPs were highly stable for several weeks in various phosphate buffers with a range of physiological pH conditions (pH = 6-8). The nanoparticles showed biocompatibility in vivo in C57BL6/J mice that encouraged us to screen the nanoparticles for various biomedical applications. The SPBANPs themselves exhibited remarkable inhibition of cancer cell proliferation (B16F10, A549, MCF-7, and SK-OV-3) in vitro. Substantial inhibition of melanoma tumor growth was observed in the C57BL6/J mouse model (aggressive murine melanoma model: B16F10) after intraperitoneal administration of the SPBANPs without any anticancer drug. Additionally, the SPBANPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity in various Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Interestingly, this nanoformulation itself works as a drug delivery vehicle, as well as an anticancer and antibacterial agent. The in vitro and in vivo results together demonstrate that this biocompatible nanoformulation (SPBANPs) without an anticancer drug or antibiotic could be explored to develop as a multifunctional therapeutic agent (2-in-1) for the treatment of cancer and bacterial infections in the near future.",

        "abstract": "It is an unquestionable fact that cancer, also called malignancy, has or will soon become the major global health care problem with an increasing incidence worldwide. Conventional treatment approaches (e.g., radiation or chemotherapy) treat both cancerous and surrounding normal tissues simultaneously, which leads to a poor therapeutic effect on tumors and severe toxic side effects on healthy tissues. Considering these thematic issues, the design and development of more efficient treatment approaches is one of the most important demands of health care in the near future. In this context, the emergence of nanotechnology opens new opportunities for addressing the issues of conventional drug delivery systems (DDSs) for cancer therapy. Theranostic nanomedicines are indebted to the advent of nanotechnology and were introduced by Funkhouser in 2002. These nanomedicines are the newest DDSs that combine diagnostic and therapeutic properties into a single platform. Theranostic nanomedicines are generally composed of targeting agents, diagnostic tracers, effective drug(s), and biomaterial(s) as the matrix to the formulation. Among these, biomaterials have a pivotal role in theranostic nanomedicines due to their direct influence on the system effectiveness. In this context, natural polymers can be considered as potential candidates, mainly due to their inherent physicochemical as well as biological advantages. However, natural polymers have some drawbacks, which can be addressed through the chemical modification approach.

        "abstract": "The use of targeted liposomes encapsulating chemotherapy drugs enhances the specific targeting of cancer cells, thus reducing the side effects of these drugs and providing patient-friendly chemotherapy treatment. Targeted pegylated (stealth) liposomes have the ability to safely deliver their loaded drugs to the cancer cells by targeting specific receptors overly expressed on the surface of these cells. Applying ultrasound as an external stimulus will safely trigger drug release from these liposomes in a controlled manner. In this study, we investigated the release kinetics of the model drug \"calcein\" from targeted liposomes sonicated with low-frequency ultrasound (20 kHz). Our results showed that pegylated liposomes were more sonosensitive compared to nonpegylated liposomes. A comparison of the effect of three targeting moieties conjugated to the surface of pegylated liposomes, namely human serum albumin (HSA), transferrin (Tf) and arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD), on calcein release kinetics was conducted. The fluorescent results showed that HSA-PEG and Tf-PEG liposomes were more sonosensitive (showing higher calcein release following the exposure to pulsed LFUS) compared to the control pegylated liposomes, thus adding more acoustic benefits to their targeting efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) presents an alternative noninvasive therapeutic modality for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. PDT relies on cytotoxic singlet oxygen (reactive oxygen species or ROS) that is locally generated through energy transfer between a photosensitizer (PS) and molecularly dissolved triplet oxygen. While a number of nanoparticle-based PS vehicles have been described, because of their beneficial and proven biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles, ultrasmall nanoparticles with diameters below 10 nm are particularly promising. Here, we investigate two different particle designs deviating from ultrasmall poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEGylated) fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles referred to as Cornell prime dots (C' dots) by replacing the fluorescent dye with a photosensitizer (psC' dots), here the methylene blue (MB) derivate MB2. In the first approach (design 1), MB2 is encapsulated into the matrix of the silica core, while in the second approach (design 2), MB2 is grafted onto the silica core surface in between chains of the sterically stabilizing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) corona. We compare both cases with regard to their singlet oxygen quantum yields, &#934;&#916;, with the effective &#934;&#916;eff per particle reaching 111 &#177; 3 and 161 &#177; 5% for designs 1 and 2, respectively, substantially exceeding single MB2 molecule performance. Encapsulation significantly improves PS photostability, while surface conjugation diminishes it, relative to free MB2. Finally, we show that both particle designs allow functionalization with a targeting peptide, cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Cys) [c(RGDyC)]. Results suggest that psC' dots are a promising targeted platform for PDT applications, e.g. in oncology, that may combine colloidal stability, efficient renal clearance limiting off-target accumulation, targeted delivery to sites of disease, and effective ROS generation maximizing therapeutic efficacy.",

Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, patient experiences with their care encounters are embedded into the framework of payment incentives. However, drivers of patient experience in the context of the supportive, nonclinical, services that relate to patient care have not been as well understood.To assess the role of organizational factors on patient experience.This cross-sectional analysis integrates hospital patient-experience scores from Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, and Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service data from 2013 to 2015 (N = 3392). Based on hospitals with \"top-box\" responses, the aggregate proportion of hospital patients responding \"always\" on a Likert scale represented a top-box hospital. Domains were split at the mean for analysis (above average = 1). Multivariable logistic regression models for each domain were analyzed against hospital factors and services, including offering a patient education center, patient-enabling services, and language services.Most hospitals reported a full-time hospitalist (64.4%) and a patient education center (60.4%), while fewer provided enabling/support services (33.7%). In multivariable models, small and medium hospitals performed better compared to the largest hospitals (300+ beds; P < .0001). Structurally, medium and small hospitals reported significantly greater odds of top-box patient-experience versus large hospitals. Across all domains, only hospitals with patient education centers returned better performance (adjusted odds ratio: 1.27-1.64; P = .0002-.0166).Patient education centers provide relevant information at the point of service and may improve overall patient experience of care. Given the growing reliance on accountable care delivery models, opportunities to partner with community health education partners may be profitable.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

        "abstract": "This volume summarizes the current scientific evidence and identifies research priorities needed to decrease social inequalities in cancer. The publication, based on the expert knowledge of more than 70 international scientists from multiple disciplines, undertakes a populations-within-populations approach, highlighting the large variations in cancer incidence, survival, and mortality that exist between countries and, within countries, between social groups. Several factors may lead individuals with low social status to adopt unhealthy behaviors, to be exposed to a wider range and a higher intensity of cancer risk factors, and to have reduced access to health-care services, compared with their fellow citizens. A special focus is given to how the phenomenon of inequalities in cancer evolves and is reshaped over time, driven by economic, social, political, legislative, and technological forces; it affects everyone, but the most disadvantaged individuals are particularly hard hit. This IARC Scientific Publication was developed to serve as a reference for policy-makers and public health officials, linking to specific examples of interventions that may reduce future inequalities in cancer.&#169; International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2019.

        "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rh2 is well known for many pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, antidiabetes, antiinflammatory, and antiobesity properties. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are ubiquitous enzymes present in nature and are widely used for the synthesis of oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoconjugates, and novel derivatives. We aimed to synthesize new ginsenosides from Rh2 using the recombinant GT enzyme and investigate its cytotoxicity with diverse cell lines.We have used a GT gene with 1,224-bp gene sequence cloned from Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LRGT)&#160;and then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant GT protein was purified and demonstrated to transform Rh2 into two novel ginsenosides, and they were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.Two novel ginsenosides with an additional glucopyranosyl (6&#8594;1) and two additional glucopyranosyl (6&#8594;1) linked with the C-3 position of the substrate Rh2 were synthesized, respectively. Cell viability assay in the lung cancer (A549) cell line showed that glucosyl ginsenoside Rh2 inhibited cell viability more potently than ginsenoside Rg3 and Rh2 at a concentration of 10 &#956;M. Furthermore, glucosyl ginsenoside Rh2 did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect in murine macrophage cells (RAW264.7), mouse embryo fibroblasts cells (3T3-L1), and skin cells (B16BL6) at a concentration of 10 &#956;M compared with ginsenoside Rh2 and Rg3.This is the first report on the synthesis of two novel ginsenosides, namely, glucosyl ginsenoside Rh2 and diglucosyl ginsenoside Rh2 from Rh2 by using recombinant GT isolated from L.&#160;rhamnosus. Moreover, diglucosyl ginsenoside Rh2 might be a new candidate for treatment of inflammation, obesity, and skin whiting, and especially for anticancer.&#169; 2020 The Korean Society of Ginseng.

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a challenging polygenic disease because the genes that cause PCa remain largely elusive and are affected by several causal factors. Consequently, research continuously strives to identify a genetic marker which could be used as an indicator to predict the most vulnerable (i.e., predisposed) segments of the population to the disease or for the gene which may be directly responsible for PCa. To enhance the genetic etiology of PCa, this research sought to discover the key studies conducted in this field using data from the main journal publication search engines, as it was hoped that this could shed light on the main research findings from these studies, which in turn could assist in determining these genes or markers. From the research highlighted, the studies primarily used two kinds of markers: short tandem repeats or single-nucleotide polymorphisms. These markers were found to be quite prevalent in all the chromosomes within the research carried out. It also became apparent that the studies differed in both quantity and quality, as well as being conducted in a variety of societies. Links were also determined between the degree and strength of the relationship between these markers and the occurrence of the disease. From the studies identified, most recommended a larger and more diverse survey for the parameters which had not been studied before, as well as an increase in the size of the community (i.e., the population) being studied. This is an indication that work in this field is far from complete, and thus, current research remains committed toward&#160;finding genetic markers that can be used clinically for the diagnosis and screening of patients with PCa.&#169; 2020 Asian Pacific Prostate Society.

Although AP-induced liver injury is well recognized as the formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite of AP, resulting in cell damage, emerging evidence indicates that AP-induced liver injury is also associated with gut microbiota. However, the gut microbiota-involved mechanism remains largely unknown. In our study, we found that vancomycin (Vac) pretreatment (100&#8239;mg/kg, twice a day for 4 days) attenuated AP-induced liver injury, altered the composition of gut microbiota, and changed serum metabolic profile. Moreover, we identified Vac pretreatment elevated cecum and serum 2-hydroxybutyric acid (2-HB), which ameliorated AP-induced cell damage and liver injury in mice by reducing AP bioavailability and elevating GSH levels. Our current results revealed the novel role of 2-HB in protecting AP-induced liver injury and add new evidence for gut microbiota in affecting AP toxicity.&#169; 2019 Xi'an Jiaotong University.

        "abstract": "Smoking cigarettes is a leading global cause of preventable death and disease. Men historically smoke more than women, but the prevalence of smoking among women in low and middle-income countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Understanding the factors that influence smoking initiation among women and girls is needed to address the growing epidemic of women smokers and the looming impact on women's health worldwide. We assume that smoking initiation is embedded in socio-culturally influenced gendered context and use a social cognitive model with a gendered lens as a framework for organizing and synthesizing the research. Guided by this framework, we identified gaps in the literature and make recommendations for future research in this review paper. The results suggest that psychological and environmental determinants are rooted in fluctuating cultural influences and values, but few research studies provide a gendered analysis or systematically examine these factors in the context of gender and culture. Sex/gender is a significant construct through which women and girls experience the psychological, environmental, and other influences on smoking initiation. Much more research is needed to understand the psychological and environmental influences as well as the intersection of gender roles and other social categories on female smoking initiation.",

There is growing evidence that Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) initiatives can increase the rate of recruitment to research. This study within a trial (SWAT) will examine if participant information co-developed by patients and their families can lead to greater recruitment rates, retention and understanding of the Rehabilitation Strategies in Oesophago-gastric and Hepatopancreaticobiliary Cancer (ReStOre II) trial when compared to standard participant information. Methods: This SWAT will be carried out over two phases. Phase I will utilise qualitative methods to develop (Phase Ia) and refine (Phase Ib) the new participant information. Phase Ia will recruit up to 20 survivors of upper gastrointestinal or hepatopancreaticobiliary cancer, or their family members, to take part in a focus group or interview to develop the new participant information. Focus groups/interviews will be recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. In Phase Ib, participants will return for a second focus group/interview to refine the participant information. Once finalised, the participant information will be submitted to ethics for approval. In Phase II, potential participants for the ReStOre II trial will be randomly assigned to receive either the standard or patient and family co-developed participant information. The two forms of participant information will be compared by recruitment and retention rates, and participant understanding of the trial (Decision-Making Questionnaire). Discussion: We anticipate that engaging with patients and their families to develop participant information will help to increase patient understanding of the ReStOre II trial and therefore recruitment and retention rates. The results of this SWAT will indicate the usefulness of this strategy for optimising recruitment to exercise rehabilitation trials in cancer survivorship.

        "abstract": "Abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are highlyconserved noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of various genes post transcriptionally to control cellular functions, has been associated with the development of many diseases. In some cases, disease-promoting miRNAs are upregulated, while in other instances disease-suppressive miRNAs are downregulated. To alleviate this imbalanced miRNA expression, either antagomiRs or miRNA mimics can be delivered to cells to inhibit or promote miRNA expression, respectively. Unfortunately, the clinical translation of bare antagomiRs and miRNA mimics has been challenging because nucleic acids are susceptible to nuclease degradation, display unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and cannot passively enter cells. This review emphasizes the challenges associated with miRNA mimic delivery and then discusses the design and implementation of polymer nanocarriers to overcome these challenges. Preclinical efforts are summarized, and a forward-looking perspective on the future clinical translation of polymer nanomaterials as miRNA delivery vehicles is provided.",

We evaluated SNAC in the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a source that affords multi-institutional, population studies of rare cancers and their outcomes. Methods &#8195;The NCDB was queried for adenocarcinoma in the sinonasal tract. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate for factors contributing to overall survival (OS). Results &#8195;A total of 553 patients were identified. The cohort was composed of 59.3% males. The nasal cavity was the most common primary site, representing 44.1% of cases. About 5.7% of patients presented with nodal disease, while 3.3% had distant metastases. About 40.6% of cases presented with stage IV disease. About 73.5% of patients underwent surgery, 54.2% received radiation therapy, and 27.7% had chemotherapy. Median OS was 71.7 months, while OS at 1, 2, and 5 years was 82, 73.0, and 52%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, advanced age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.05), Charlson-Deyo score of 1 (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.20-3.30), advanced tumor grade (HR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.39-5.34), and advanced tumor stage (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.33-5.50) were associated with worse OS, whereas surgery (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.20-0.60) and radiation therapy (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33-0.91), but not chemotherapy (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.66-2.05), predicted improved OS.

We report two additional cases of amyloid localized to Meckel's cave with secondary involvement of the trigeminal nerves bilaterally, with protein characterization by mass spectrometry. The patients, both females, 39 and 49-years-old, respectively, presented with the insidious onset of progressive trigeminal neuropathy, including pain and numbness with sensory loss, refractory to medical therapy. One patient experienced bilateral symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal thickening and contrast enhancement along Meckel's cave bilaterally in both cases. The clinical differential diagnosis included benign neoplasms and inflammatory disorders. At the time of biopsy, the trigeminal nerve was noted to be enlarged and multinodular in one case and associated with abnormal soft tan tissue in the other case. Microscopically, the nerve biopsies showed extensive Congo red-positive amyloid deposits. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated that the amyloid was of (AL)-type in both cases (AL [kappa] in one case and AL [lambda] in the other).

        "abstract": "Background &#8195;Due to the diverse histopathologic features and variable survival rates seen in sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC), it is likely that this diagnostic entity is comprised of a heterogonous group of morphologically undifferentiated tumors. As advancements in molecular testing have led to a better understanding of tumor biology, it has become increasingly evident that SNUC may actually encompass several tumor subtypes with different clinical behavior. As a result, it is also likely that all SNUC patients cannot be treated in the same fashion. Recent investigations have identified loss of the tumor suppressor SMARCB1 (INI1) expression in a subset of undifferentiated sinonasal tumors and extrasinonasal tumors and, studies have suggested that this genetic aberration may be a poor prognostic marker. The objective of this study was to identify differential expression of SMARCB1 in SNUC and to analyze and compare the survival outcomes in SNUC patients with and without SMARCB1 expression. Methods &#8195;All cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated neoplasms of the sinonasal tract treated between 2007 and 2018 at a single tertiary care institution were selected. All cases of SNUC were tested for SMARCB1 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical parameters were analyzed using Student's t -test and Fischer's test. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival durations, while comparison between both the subgroups was done using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of SPSS software, Version 25 (IBM, New York, NY, United States). Results &#8195;Fourteen cases of SNUC were identified. Approximately two-thirds (64%; n &#8201;=&#8201;9) of patients were male and the majority (79%; n &#8201;=&#8201;11) were between fifth to seventh decade. Skull base and orbital invasion were seen in 79% ( n &#8201;=&#8201;11) and 93% ( n &#8201;=&#8201;13) of cases, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of tumors ( n &#8201;=&#8201;8) retained SMARCB1 expression by IHC (SR-SNUC), while the remaining 43% ( n &#8201;=&#8201;6) showed loss of SMARCB1 expression and, thus, were considered as SMARCB1 -deficient (SD-SNUC). Although clinicopathological features and treatment modalities were similar, SD-SNUC showed poorer (OS: p &#8201;=&#8201;0.07; disease free survival [DFS]: p &#8201;=&#8201;0.02) overall survival (OS) and DFS on Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, SD-SNUC showed higher recurrence (75 vs. 17%) and mortality (67 vs. 14%) (hazard rate&#8201;=&#8201;8.562; p &#8201;=&#8201;0.05) rates. Both OS (28.82&#8201;&#177;&#8201;31.15 vs. 53.24&#8201;&#177;&#8201;37.50) and DFS durations (10.62&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10.26 vs. 43.79&#8201;&#177;&#8201;40.97) were consistently worse for SD-SNUC. Five-year survival probabilities were lower for SD-SNUC (0.33 vs. 0.85). Conclusion &#8195;SNUC represents a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated sinonasal malignancies. Based on the status of SMARCB1 expression, the two subgroups SD-SNUC and SR-SNUC appear to represent distinct clinical entities, with loss of SMARCB1 expression conferring an overall worse prognosis.Thieme.

The site of bleeding was the primary tumour in 50 (71.4%) patients, whereas fungating regional nodes were the cause in the remaining. The median duration between initial diagnosis and HRT was 5 (range 0-19) months. Seventeen patients (24.3%) had a history of prior radiotherapy. Fifty-one patients (72.8%) required at least 1 unit of blood transfusion. Hypofractionated HRT schedules were used in all patients with the most common being 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions for 5 days a week (18, 25.7%). At the end of HRT, bleeding was effectively controlled in 53 patients (75.7%). The median survival was 13 (range 1-26) months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 55.7% and 4.3%, respectively.HRT is safe and effective in achieving haemostasis in advanced tumours presenting with bleeding from either the primary or the regional lymph nodes. Although optimal dose fractionation has not yet established, hypofractionated radiotherapy is preferred, with the total dose depending on several factors. However, the overall prognosis remains poor.",

It is characterized by dynamic and subjectivity and the way it is perceived is regulated by internal and external factors. Life satisfaction can be described in subjective and objective categories, by various indicators.The aim of the study was to evaluate the determinants of satisfaction with life in selected aspects among women of reproductive age.The study was conducted on 280 women, selected according to the following criteria: age range 18-45, at least one sexual intercourse per month, lack of chronic diseases or cancer, and consent to participate in the research. The research instruments used were: Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).Life satisfaction increased with age (p<0.0001), higher life satisfaction was reported by women with higher education (p<0.001), married, (p<0.01), talked with their partner about their sexual expectations (p=0.03) and did not want to change anything in their sexual life (p<0.001). Analysis revealed a positive correlation between life satisfaction and sexual satisfaction (p < 0.0001).Higher level of sexual satisfaction and sexual health is related to better satisfaction with life. Factors affecting sexual satisfaction include residence, having children, discussing one's sexual expectations with their partner, feeling no need to change one's sex life, and frequency of sexual activity.",

        "abstract": "Chromosomal microarray analysis has emerged as a primary diagnostic tool in prenatally diagnosed congenital heart disease and other structural anomalies in clinical practice.Our study aimed to investigate the diagnostic yield of microarray analysis as a first-tier test for chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with both isolated and nonisolated congenital heart disease and to identify the association of different pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities with different subgroups of congenital heart disease.Retrospective data from 217 pregnancies that were diagnosed with congenital heart disease between 2011 and 2016 were reviewed. All pregnancies were investigated with the use of microarray analysis during the study period. Classification of chromosomal abnormalities was done based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines into (1) pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities that included numeric chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy and partial aneuploidy) and pathogenic copy number variants (22q11.2 deletion and other microdeletions/microduplications), (2) variants of uncertain significance, and (3) normal findings.Our study found a detection rate for pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities (numeric and pathogenic copy number variants) of 36.9% in pregnancies (n=80) that were diagnosed prenatally with congenital heart disease who underwent invasive testing with chromosomal microarray. The detection rate for numeric abnormalities was 29.5% (n=64) and for pathogenic copy number variants was 7.4% (n=16) of which 4.2% were 22q11.2 deletion and 3.2% were other pathogenic copy number variants, most of which theoretically could have been missed by the use of conventional karyotype alone. Pathogenic copy number variants were most common in conotruncal defects (19.6%; 11/56) that included 42.9% in cases of interrupted aortic arch, 23.8% in cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 13.3% in cases of transposition of the great arteries, and 8.3% in cases of double outlet right ventricle. Of these changes, 81.8% were 22q11.2 deletion, and 18.2% were other microdeletions/microduplications. After conotruncal defects, pathogenic copy number variants were most common in right ventricular outflow tract and left ventricular outflow tract groups (8% and 2.2%, respectively) in which none were 22q11.2 deletion. Pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities (numeric and pathogenic copy number variants) detected by chromosomal microarray analysis were significantly more common in the nonisolated congenital heart disease group (64.5%; n=49) compared with the isolated group (22%; n=31; P<.001).In pregnancies that were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and had undergone diagnostic genetic testing, our study showed that chromosomal microarray analysis has an added value in the detection of pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities compared with conventional karyotype, particularly in cases of pathogenic copy number variants. This yield is influenced not only by the type of congenital heart disease but also by the presence of extracardiac anomalies.Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Our analysis included 3,478 breast cancer cases among 24,519 control women from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII). We first examined associations with residential location during adolescence (high school address) or early adulthood (address in 1991). We then assessed the contribution from known individual-level risk factors, measures of socioeconomic status (SES), and occupational and environmental factors that vary spatially and have been linked to breast cancer. Secondary analyses by estrogen receptor (ER) and menopausal status were also conducted.We identified geographic patterns of breast cancer risk associated with location during adolescence, with increased risk apparent in Michigan, the Northwest, and the New York City area, that shifted to southern New England when addresses during early adulthood were analyzed. Similar results were observed after adjustment for individual- and area-level factors, although spatial associations were no longer statistically significant.Breast cancer risk is not spatially uniform across the U.S. and incidence patterns varied depending on the timing during life of the residence considered. Geographic disparities persisted even after accounting for established and suspected breast cancer risk factors, suggesting that unmeasured environmental or lifestyle risk factors may explain geographic variation in risk in different parts of the country.",

However, the ultimate potential of these advanced imaging modalities has not been fully exploited. The dependency of dMRI on the diffusion weighting gradient strength and diffusion time can be utilized to measure tumor perfusion, cellular structure, and cellular membrane permeability. Similarly, DCE-MRI can be used to measure vascular and cellular membrane permeability along with cellular compartment volume fractions. To facilitate the understanding of these potentially important methods for quantitative cancer imaging, we discuss the basic concepts and recent developments, as well as future directions for further development.",

We hypothesized that IMRT with CBCT would reduce dose to the rectum, bowel, and bladder compared to 3D-CRT.We reviewed nineteen patients treated with maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by concurrent chemotherapy with IMRT. All patients received 45 Gy to the entire empty bladder followed by 19.8 Gy tumor boost treated with full bladder. 3D-CRT treatment plans were created for the same prescription. Paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test analyzed dosimetry and bladder volumes.The rectum and bowel V40, V45, V50, V55, and V60 were reduced by over 50% in the IMRT plans compared to 3D-CRT (p<0.0001). IMRT also reduced volume of bladder irradiated compared to 3D-CRT (p<0.01). After CBCT, patients were likely to undergo clinically significant shifts &#8805; 0.5 cm before boost delivery (p=0.001). Bladder volumes were significantly lower during boost treatments compared to pre-treatment simulation (p=0.002). There were 4 (21%) grade 3 genitourinary toxicities and 1 (5%) grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity.IMRT is superior to 3D-CRT for bladder cancer and spares dose to bowel, rectum, and bladder with improved acute toxicity compared to published clinical literature. For boost treatment, daily full bladder volume and positioning are not always reproducible, supporting the need for CBCT for optimal localization of the primary bladder tumor.",

This study tested the serial indirect effects of sibling bereavement on adolescents' externalizing problems through parent distress (i.e., internalizing symptoms) and parenting (i.e., parenting behaviors, parent-adolescent communication).During home visits, 72 bereaved adolescents (ages 10-18) whose brother/sister died from cancer and 60 comparison peers reported about their externalizing problems and their mothers' and fathers' parenting behaviors (warmth, behavioral control, psychological control) and parent-adolescent communication (open communication, problematic communication). Mothers and fathers reported their own internalizing symptoms.Bereaved siblings reported more externalizing problems (p =.048) and bereaved mothers reported more internalizing symptoms relative to the comparison group (p =.015). Serial multiple mediation models indicated that elevated externalizing problems were partially explained by both bereaved mothers' internalizing symptoms and parenting and communication (less warmth [CI: 0.04, 0.86], more psychological control [CI: 0.03, 0.66], and more problematic mother-adolescent communication [CI: 0.03, 0.79]), with a significant indirect effect also emerging for open mother-adolescent communication [CI: 0.05, 1.59]. Bereaved fathers did not significantly differ in internalizing symptoms from comparison fathers (p =.453), and no significant indirect effects emerged for fathers.Elevated externalizing problems in bereaved siblings may result from mothers' distress and the impact on their parenting and communication.

        "abstract": "Heme iron overload has been implicated as the main cause of the increased risk of cancer due to the consumption of red meat. However, fish and shellfish, teas, and spices contain up to five times more iron than red meat. There is insufficient evidence that iron intake in dietary red meat is the primary causal factor for colorectal cancer. In addition, harmful substances produced during the preparation of red meat, including heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), N-nitroso compounds, and acrylamide, are extrinsic factors that increase carcinogenicity. HCAs are produced during the cooking of red meat, poultry meat, and fish. PAHs may also be produced during the cooking of diverse food groups, such as dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and cereals. The average daily intake of red meat among Korean individuals is 62 g; the amount of PAHs entering the body via red meat is less than the average amount of PAHs the body is exposed to in the air. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that dietary red meat is the main cause of colorectal cancer.

To investigate whether systemic concentrations of these markers are associated with future MM risk and progression from its precursor, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), we conducted a prospective study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.We measured concentrations of 45 immunologic and pro-angiogenic markers in sera from 241 MM case patients, 441 participants with nonprogressing MGUS, and 258 MGUS-free control participants using Luminex-based multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. We also evaluated absolute risk of progression using weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates. All statistical tests were two-sided.Prediagnostic levels of six markers were statistically significantly elevated among MM case patients compared with MGUS-free control participants using a false discovery rate of 10% (EGF, HGF, Ang-2, CXCL12, CCL8, and BMP-9). Of these, three angiogenesis markers were associated with future progression from MGUS to MM: EGF (fourth vs first quartile: OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.01, 95% CI = 1.61 to 5.63, P trend = .00028), HGF (OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.33 to 5.03, P trend = .015), and Ang-2 (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.15 to 3.98, P trend = .07).

This study aimed to investigate prognostic factors in patients undergoing GELM resection. From 2001 to 2015, 31 consecutive patients underwent resection for GELM; and factors for poor prognosis were evaluated. Of the 31 patients, 23 (74.2%) developed multiple liver metastases. The histology of gastric cancer was intestinal-type adenocarcinoma in 21 patients (67.7%). Median overall survival (OS) was 3.2 years. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 92.8%, 56.2%, and 42.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 58.5%, 31.3%, and 31.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that intestinal-type adenocarcinoma was associated with a significantly lower risk of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; p =0.022) and RFS (HR, 0.25; p = 0.008). In multiple logistic regression analysis, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (odds ratio, 0.14; p = 0.012) reduced incidence of extra-hepatic recurrence after GELM resection. In conclusion, GELM resection in patients with intestinal-type histology is preferable because intestinal-type adenocarcinoma is associated with better prognosis and a lower incidence of extra-hepatic recurrence than diffuse/other-type adenocarcinoma.2019, National Center for Global Health and Medicine.",

        "abstract": "Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung consists of only spindle-shaped tumor cells, and accounts for approximately 13.3% of all sarcomatoid carcinomas (SCs), which are a rare subtype of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung has very poor prognosis owing to resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This case report describes a 76-year-old man who presented with complaints of dry cough and right-sided neck pain and was later diagnosed with spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. He had a medical history of type 2 diabetes, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hepatitis B and a 20 pack-year history of smoking. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass with a thick-walled cavity in the right upper lobe of the lung. His neck pain was consistent with PET-CT images, indicating metastases due to invasion of lung cancer cells. The expression of PD-L1 in more than 90% of the tumor cells of the lung biopsy tissue led to the administration of pembrolizumab. The lung and metastatic tumors dramatically decreased in size after 9 weeks, and no tumor regrowth was observed over 11 courses of pembrolizumab administration. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports describing the use of pembrolizumab for spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. This case report suggests that immunotherapy could be a promising treatment option for rare types of lung cancers, including spindle cell carcinoma.Copyright &#169; Japan Medical Association.",

        "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). A correlation between the development of irAEs and efficacy has been suggested; however, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and the development of these events.We performed a retrospective study of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy at our institution between May 2015 and April 2018 (n = 44). Patients were categorized into two groups, specifically those with irAEs (irAE group) or without (non-irAE group), and we evaluated the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Predictors of irAEs were examined by multivariate analysis.irAEs of any grade occurred in 31 (70.5%) patients. The median PFS was 10.9 months in the irAE group versus 3.7 months in the non-irAE group (P < 0.001). ORR and DCR were also higher in the irAE group than in the non-irAE group. Furthermore, high PD-L1 expression (&#8805;50%) was a predictive factor of irAE based on logistic regression (P = 0.004).In patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, ORR, DCR, and PFS were significantly better in the irAE group than in the non-irAE group. High PD-L1 expression, at the time of pretreatment, was identified as an independent predictor of irAE development. We believe that more careful management of irAEs for individuals with high PD-L1 expression is needed to improve clinical benefits. Further, PD-L1 expression might be useful for ICI risk management.Copyright &#169; Japan Medical Association.",

        "abstract": "Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) as probable carcinogenic substances are mainly generated in meat products during thermal processing. Numerous studies have contributed to the analysis, formation, and mitigation of HAAs during food processing. However, few articles have comprehensively reviewed food safety aspects from both food processing and dietary intake regarding the formation, mitigation, metabolism, biomarkers for exposure, hazard control, and risk assessment of HAAs, and related food safety researches. Several factors may influence the generation of HAAs, including processing temperature, processing time, and chemical composition of the meat. Nonetheless, these mutagenic compounds are attenuated to different levels by the addition of natural or synthetic flavorings and antioxidant-rich marinades, as well as pretreatments using technique such as microwave heating. After dietary intake, different types of HAAs are metabolized in humans by several enzymes, including cytochrome P450s, peroxidases, N-acetyltransferases, sulfotransferases, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. Their primary metabolites are further conjugated with DNA or ultimately excreted in urine and feces. The 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine in hair as well as DNA, hemoglobin, and serum albumin adducts has been considered as biomarkers for exposure assessment. Dietary intake information obtained from questionnaires and the results of epidemiological investigations have shown a positive relationship between the intakes of red meat and processed meat and high risk of cancer incidence. As several cancers have been reported to be associated with HAAs, HAAs should be both effectively reduced during food processing and controlled from dietary intake to facilitate human health.&#169; 2019 Institute of Food Technologists&#174;.",

        "abstract": "The contribution of measurable immunological and inflammatory parameters to lung cancer development remains unclear, particularly among never smokers. We investigated the relationship between total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts and incident lung cancer risk overall and among subgroups defined by smoking status and sex in the United Kingdom (UK).We evaluated 424 407 adults aged 37-73&#8201;years from the UK Biobank. Questionnaires, physical measurements, and blood were administered and collected at baseline in 2006-2010. Complete blood cell counts were measured using standard methods. Lung cancer diagnoses and histological classifications were obtained from cancer registries. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals of incident lung cancer in relation to quartiles (Q) of total WBC and subtype-specific counts, with Q1 as the reference.There were 1493 incident cases diagnosed over an average 7-year follow-up. Overall, the highest quartile of total WBC count was statistically significantly associated with elevated lung cancer risk (HRQ4 = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.41 to 1.98). Among women, increased risks were found in current smokers (n cases / n&#8201;=&#8201;244 / 19&#8202;464, HRQ4 = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.46 to 3.16), former smokers (n cases / n&#8201;=&#8201;280 / 69&#8202;198, HRQ4 = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.47), and never smokers without environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ncases / n&#8201;=&#8201;108 / 111&#8202;294, HRQ4 = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.11 to 3.35). Among men, stronger associations were identified in current smokers (ncase s / n&#8201;=&#8201;329 / 22&#8202;934, HRQ4 = 2.95, 95% CI = 2.04 to 4.26) and former smokers (nc ases / n&#8201;=&#8201;358/71&#8202;616, HRQ4 = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.74 to 3.27) but not in never smokers. Findings were similar for lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and were driven primarily by elevated neutrophil fractions.Elevated WBCs could potentially be one of many important markers for increased lung cancer risk, especially among never-smoking women and ever-smoking men.Published by Oxford University Press 2019.

Dermatologists play a critical role in acute and chronic GVHD, as skin involvement is common and often the earliest involved site of disease [2].GVHD shares clinical and histopathological features with a variety of other skin diseases, requiring thorough consideration of differential diagnoses in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with lesions suggestive of cutaneous GVHD. Treatment considerations for GVHD are influenced by factors such as disease classification, overall grading, organ involvement, associated symptoms, and immunological anti-tumor effect. Several treatments are available and may be indicated as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy to allow faster withdrawal or tapering of immunosuppression. While corticosteroids are often first line therapy, oral ruxolitinib has been recently approved for treatment of steroid-refractory aGHVD, and oral ibrutinib has been approved for steroid-refractory cGHVD.This article provides current clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations relevant to the hospitalist for both acute and chronic mucocutaneous GVHD.

Thus, additional biomarkers appear to be necessary to more precisely identify potential responders. A comprehensive analysis of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) and peripheral blood may identify potential biomarkers for a more accurate selection of patients likely to respond to ICB.Herein, we summarize key features of the breast TME, and beyond, that may hold predictive power in determining immunotherapy benefit.

        "abstract": "In survival analysis, Cox model is widely used for most clinical trial data. Alternatives include the additive hazard model, the accelerated failure time (AFT) model and a more general transformation model. All these models assume that the effects for all covariates are on the same scale. However, it is possible that for different covariates, the effects are on different scales. In this paper, we propose a shape-invariant hazard regression model that allows us to estimate the multiplicative treatment effect with adjustment of covariates that have non-multiplicative effects. We propose moment-based inference procedures for the regression parameters. We also discuss the risk prediction and the goodness of fit test for our proposed model. Numerical studies show good finite sample performance of our proposed estimator. We applied our method to the HIVNET 012 study, a milestone trial of single-dose nevirapine in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. From the HIVNET 012 data analysis, single-dose nevirapine treatment is shown to improve 18-month infant survival significantly with appropriate adjustment of the maternal CD4 counts and the virus load.",

Existing decomposition methods often focus on the orthogonality between the common and distinctive matrices, but inadequately consider the more necessary orthogonal relationship between the two distinctive matrices. The latter guarantees that no more shared information is extractable from the distinctive matrices. We propose decomposition-based canonical correlation analysis (D-CCA), a novel decomposition method that defines the common and distinctive matrices from the  L 2   space of random variables rather than the conventionally used Euclidean space, with a careful construction of the orthogonal relationship between distinctive matrices. D-CCA represents a natural generalization of the traditional canonical correlation analysis. The proposed estimators of common and distinctive matrices are shown to be consistent and have reasonably better performance than some state-of-the-art methods in both simulated data and the real data analysis of breast cancer data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas.",

The goal is to select the common set of predictors which affect both the responses, and not just only one of them. In addition, we develop a survival prediction model based on data integration. This article is motivated by the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) databank, which is currently the largest genomics and transcriptomics database. The data contain cancer survival information along with cancer stages for each patient. Furthermore, it contains Reverse-phase Protein Array (RPPA) measurements for each individual, which are the predictors associated with these responses. The biological motivation is to identify the major actionable proteins associated with both survival outcomes and cancer stages. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly model the survival time and the classification of the cancer stages. Moreover, to deal with the high dimensionality of the RPPA measurements, we use a shrinkage prior to identify significant proteins. Simulations and TCGA data analysis show that the joint integrated modeling approach improves survival prediction.",

Hence, a nanostructure targeting DR5 would act as a dual targeting and therapeutic agent. We report here on a peptide amphiphile (PA) containing a dimeric, cyclic peptide that self-assembles into cylindrical supramolecular nanofibers and targets DR5. Coassembly of the DR5-targeting PA and a pegylated PA creates a supramolecular nanoscale construct with enhanced binding affinity to DR5 relative to a monomeric targeting PA, and was found to be cytotoxic in vitro. When combined with the chemotherapy paclitaxel, DR5-targeting carriers showed potent antitumor activity in vivo, demonstrating the multifunctional capabilities of peptide-based supramolecular nanostructures.",

Type 1 diabetes can be treated with islet transplantation; however, patients must be administered immunosuppressants to prevent immune rejection of the transplanted islets if they are not autologous or not engineered with immune protection/isolation. To overcome biological barriers of islet transplantation, encapsulation strategies have been developed and robustly investigated. While islet encapsulation can prevent the need for immunosuppressants, these approaches have not shown much success in clinical trials due to a lack of long-term insulin production. Multiple engineering strategies have been used to improve encapsulation and post-transplantation islet survival. In addition, more efficient islet cryopreservation methods have been designed to facilitate the scaling-up of islet transplantation. Other islet sources have been identified including porcine islets and stem cell-derived islet-like aggregates. Overall, islet-laden capsule transplantation has greatly improved over the past 30 years and is moving towards becoming a clinically feasible treatment for type 1 diabetes.",

While routine screening with Pap smear testing has reduced the burden of cervical cancer in the high-income countries, the implementation of organised Pap-based screening programmes has not been found feasible in low-resource settings due to a lack of health care delivery infrastructure and limited health budgets. The well-established causal relationship between cervical cancer development and high-risk-HPV (HR-HPV) infection and the subsequent appreciation of the greater sensitivity of HPV testing over Pap smear cytology eventually lead to HPV testing being incorporated in the primary cervical cancer prevention programmes. An organised cervical cancer screening programme incorporating HR-HPV testing and HPV vaccine administration are currently considered to be the two major interventions for a comprehensive cervical cancer control programme worldwide. However, there are concerns that the requirement of a sophisticated infrastructure with its associated costs may make cervical cancer screening using molecular prevention by HPV testing impracticable to be implemented, especially in resource-poor, low-income countries. Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) represents one of the alternative methods for cervical cancer screening proposed for the countries with low- to middle-income resources and has gained popularity in India following the successful completion of two randomised controlled trials, but this method but has low sensitivity to detect cervical pre-cancers. More recently, the cost-effectiveness analysis of many studies including randomised controlled trials, even from the low-resource settings, has found that HPV testing is followed by treatment for HPV-positive women to be an effective and cost-effective screening strategy as compared to other screening methods including VIA. The incorporation of self-sampling and HPV testing by partial genotyping has the potential to significantly add to the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness. The current status and future perspectives of molecular prevention strategies for cervical cancer prevention is further discussed.&#169; Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2019.",

Thirty-five patients with preoperative histological diagnosis of endometrial cancer without any extrauterine involvement on imaging were included in the study. Sentinel node mapping was done by cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid on the evening before surgery. Scintigraphic images were taken using gamma camera. Intraoperatively, nodes showing radioactivity were detected using hand-held gamma probe, dissected out separately and labelled as sentinel lymph nodes. Detection rate was calculated and analysed with respect to various parameters. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is feasible in endometrial cancer using cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid. SLN detection was done in 33 (94.3%) out of 35 patients. Bilateral detection was feasible in 19 patients (54.3%) with detection in left and right hemipelvis being 74.3%. Detection rate of SLN was 93.7% in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Sentinel node was detected in all the patients with non-endometrioid histology. The SLNB using cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid is feasible in endometrial cancer. It is a safe and easily reproducible technique with good detection rate and high sensitivity. Stage of the tumour, grade and myometrial invasion do not seem to have an influence on sentinel node detection.

Those complex objects (e.g, different brain subcortical structures) often reside in some Banach spaces, and hence their relationship cannot be well characterized by most of the existing measures of dependence such as correlation coefficients developed in Hilbert spaces. To overcome the limitations of the existing measures, we propose Ball Covariance as a generic measure of dependence between two random objects in two possibly different Banach spaces. Our Ball Covariance possesses the following attractive properties: (i) It is nonparametric and model-free, which make the proposed measure robust to model mis-specification; (ii) It is nonnegative and equal to zero if and only if two random objects in two separable Banach spaces are independent; (iii) Empirical Ball Covariance is easy to compute and can be used as a test statistic of independence. We present both theoretical and numerical results to reveal the potential power of the Ball Covariance in detecting dependence. Also importantly, we analyze two real datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of Ball Covariance in the complex dependence detection.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the current literature on technical feasibility and diagnostic value of PET/MRI in management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).A systematic literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database identified studies that evaluated the role of simultaneous PET/MRI for the evaluation of neuroendocrine tumors in human subjects. Exclusion criteria included studies lacking simultaneous PET/MRI, absence of other than attenuation-correction MRI pulse sequences, and case reports. No data-pooling or statistical analysis was performed due to the small number of articles and heterogeneity of the methodologies.From the 21 identified articles, five were included, which demonstrated successful technical feasibility of simultaneous PET/MRI through various imaging protocols in a total of 105 patients. All articles demonstrated equal or superior detection of liver lesions by PET/MRI over PET/CT. While one study reported superior detection of bone lesions by PET/MRI, two demonstrated favorable detection by PET/CT. Two studies demonstrated superiority of PET/CT in detection of nodal metastases; three studies reported the pitfall of PET/MRI in detection of lung lesion.The current literature reports successful technical feasibility of PET/MRI for imaging of NETs. While whole-body PET/CT in conjunction with an abdominal MRI may serve as a comprehensive approach for baseline staging, follow up with PET/MRI may be preferred for those with liver-only disease. Another possible role for PET/MRI is to provide a multiparametric approach to follow up of response to treatment. With further advances in MRI imaging acquisitions and post-processing techniques, PET/MRI may become more applicable to a broader group of patients with NETs, and possibly the imaging modality of choice for this patient population.",

        "abstract": "The 2017-2018 North American influenza season caused more hospitalizations and deaths than any year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The majority of recorded influenza infections were caused by A(H3N2) viruses, with most of the virus's North American diversity falling into the A2 clade. Within A2, we observe a subclade which we call A2/re that rose to comprise almost 70 per cent of A(H3N2) viruses circulating in North America by early 2018. Unlike most fast-growing clades, however, A2/re contains no amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) segment. Moreover, hemagglutination inhibition assays did not suggest substantial antigenic differences between A2/re viruses and viruses sampled during the 2016-2017 season. Rather, we observe that the A2/re clade was the result of a reassortment event that occurred in late 2016 or early 2017 and involved the combination of the HA and PB1 segments of an A2 virus with neuraminidase (NA) and other segments a virus from the clade A1b. The success of this clade shows the need for antigenic analysis that targets NA in addition to HA. Our results illustrate the potential for non-HA drivers of viral success and necessitate the need for more thorough tracking of full viral genomes to better understand the dynamics of influenza epidemics.Published by Oxford University Press 2019.

        "abstract": "Purpose: In 2015, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a draft vapor containment protocol to quantitatively evaluate combined liquid, aerosol, and vapor containment performance of commercially available closed-system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) that claim to be effective for gas/vapor containment within a controlled test environment. Until the release of this proposed protocol, no standard method for evaluating airtightness of CSTDs existed. The aim of this study was to evaluate six commercially available CSTDs utilizing NIOSH draft protocol methodology to evaluate vapor containment under a robust vapor challenge. Methods: In this study, six commercially available CSTDs were tested utilizing draft NIOSH vapor containment protocol methodology to simulate drug compounding and administration using 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as the challenge agent. All device manipulations were carried out in an enclosed test chamber. A Miran sapphIRe gas analyzer was used to detect IPA vapor levels that escaped the device. Study test included the two tasks designated by the NIOSH protocol, with additional steps added to the evaluation. Tasks were repeated 10 times for each device. Results: Only three of the six tested CSTDs (Equashield&#174;, HALO&#174;, and PhaSealTM) had an average IPA vapor release below the quantifiable performance threshold (1.0 ppm) for all tasks performed. This value was selected by NIOSH to represent the performance threshold for successful containment. The remaining three CSTDs had vapor release above 1 ppm at various times during the IPA manipulation process. Conclusion: Equashield&#174;, HALO&#174;, and PhaSealTM devices tested met the 2015 NIOSH protocol quantifiable performance threshold, functioning as a truly closed system. Quantifiable effective data may be useful in product selection.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

FIT-interval CRCs were identified from the British Columbia cancer registry. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with the detection of CRC and high-risk polyps (nonmalignant findings that required a 3-year surveillance colonoscopy) in those patients undergoing FIT and colonoscopy.Of the 1387 participants with a FDR with CRC, 1244 completed FIT with a positivity rate of 10.8%, 52 declined FIT but underwent colonoscopy and 90 declined screening. Seven CRCs were identified: six in patients with a positive FIT, one in a patient who only had colonoscopy. No CRCs were found in patients with a negative FIT. The positive and negative predictive values of FIT in the detection of CRC were 4.8% and 100%, respectively. On multivariate logistic regression, positive FIT, and not type of family history, was the only variable associated with detection of CRC or high-risk polyps. At 2-year follow-up, there was no FIT interval cancer detected in the study cohort.FIT is more strongly associated with high-risk findings on colonoscopy than type of family history. FIT may be an alternative screening strategy to colonoscopy in individuals with a single FDR with CRC.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

A 57-year-old female with breast cancer with bone metastasis presented dyspnea at rest 3 months after beginning treatment with palbociclib and letrozole.

It is a rare histological variant in young patients and usually presents without lymph node involvement, and its pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is rarely reported.Pure mucinous breast carcinoma in a 25-year-old female was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 8 cycles. After the fifth cycle, the mass size showed no change. We performed modified radical mastectomy in the left breast and axillary lymph node clearance. However, the pathological report showed a complete elimination of both the breast tumor and axillary lymph nodes, which were filled with mucus but did not contain malignant cells.Chemotherapy was profoundly effective against the tumor cells, but ineffective against large amounts of extracellular mucus. Even though the cancer cells were sensitive to chemotherapy, the volume of mucinous cancer couldnot be reduced.In summary, the evaluation criteria of tumor response to chemotherapy based on maximum diameter only should be considered insufficient for mucinous carcinoma.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

Unfortunately, such subgroup analyses often are exploratory and rarely statistically adequately powered and may thus be misleading. This analysis aimed to explore a potentially different treatment response to i.v. therapies between visceral and non-visceral MBC.In a systematic literature analysis (PubMed) comprising phase III registration studies for MBC from 1994 to 2014, differences in outcome were evaluated regarding progression-free survival, time to progression, overall survival (OS), and visceral versus non-visceral disease. The impact of HER2 and hormone receptor status was also considered. A total of 16 studies comprising 13,083 patients were selected by considering the information given in the medical product's professional information and the decision of the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicine Agency for approval of the respective therapeutic agents now used in the treatment of MBC.No statistically significant differences regarding treatment response and therapy benefit were found in MBC patients with visceral versus non-visceral metastases based on reported hazard ratios and confidence intervals in registration trials. Interesting but nonsignificant differences were found regarding a distinct therapy benefit regarding different metastasis locations in 4 studies.For targeted i.v. therapies based on biomarker selection, there is a trend - although not significant - toward a benefit (OS) from combination therapies favoring visceral disease. However, at the present time, metastasis localization should not be used as a predictive marker for choice of systemic therapy in MBC.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

Mean crude and age-adjusted scores for overall QoL, breast and body image (BBI), and five functional scales (FS) were comparable between groups of detection mode. Clearly lower adjusted means for most scores were observed in women with interval cancers, if time since diagnosis was less than 5 years. Cases younger than 60 years showed lower values for some FS, particularly among interval and screen-detected cases.In summary, cases with breast cancer showed health-related score values that were similar to the general population of the same age. There was also no indication that mode of detection markedly influenced these scores. However, after adjusting for tumor stage and other influential factors, screening participants appeared more susceptible to score declines after a diagnosis of cancer than non-participants.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

Despite advances in radiology and the description of suspicious nipple discharge, pre-operative diagnosis of malignancy still evades us. The aim of this study was to review the pathological findings of total duct excision and microdochectomy with reference to pre-operative symptoms, ultrasound, or mammographic findings and identify features associated with increased likelihood of malignant disease.Data were collected retrospectively of all patients who underwent total duct excision surgery in a single centre (2011-2017). Pre-operative demographics, symptoms, and imaging findings were recorded and correlated with subsequent pathology.214 patients underwent total duct excision; data were available for 211.

Although psychological and financial harms have been reported for other cancers, there are currently limited data specific to HCC. An ongoing multi-center prospective study assessing all four types of harms should provide data in near future.HCC screening may prevent death by diagnosing tumors at an early stage, but limited sensitivity and specificity of screening tests can result in unintended harms.

        "abstract": "One of the major barriers in utilizing prodrug nanocarriers for cancer therapy is the slow release of parent drug in tumors. Tumor cells generally display the higher oxidative level than normal cells, and also displayed the heterogeneity in terms of redox homeostasis level. We previously found that the disulfide bond-linkage demonstrates surprising oxidation-sensitivity to form the hydrophilic sulfoxide and sulphone groups. Herein, we develop oxidation-strengthened prodrug nanosystem loaded with pyropheophorbide a (PPa) to achieve light-activatable cascade drug release and enhance therapeutic efficacy. The disulfide bond-driven prodrug nanosystems not only respond to the redox-heterogeneity in tumor, but also respond to the exogenous oxidant (singlet oxygen) elicited by photosensitizers. Once the prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) are activated under irradiation, they would undergo an oxidative self-strengthened process, resulting in a facilitated drug cascade release. The IC50 value of the PPa@PTX-S-S NPs without irradiation was 2-fold higher than those of NPs plus irradiation. In vivo, the PPa@PTX prodrug NPs display prolonged systemic circulation and increased accumulation in tumor site. The PPa@PTX-S-S NPs showed much higher efficiency than free PTX or the PPa@PTX-C-C NPs to suppress the growth of 4T1 tumors. Therefore, this novel oxidation-strengthened disulfide-bridged prodrug-nanosystem has a great potential in the enhanced efficacy of cancer synergetic photochemotherapy.&#169; 2019 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

Here, we report a pH-sensitive and biocompatible polyprodrug based on dextran-doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug (DOXDT) for enhanced chemotherapy. High-density DOX component was covalently decorated on the nanocarrier and the drug molecules could be effectively released in the acidic tumor tissue/cells, improving chemotherapy efficacy. Specifically, a dextran-based copolymer was preliminarily prepared by one-step atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP); then DOX was conjugated on the copolymer component via pH-responsive hydrazone bond. The structure of DOXDT can be well-controlled. The resulting DOXDT was able to further self-assemble into nanoscale micelles with a hydration diameter of about 32.4&#8239;nm, which presented excellent micellar stability. Compared to lipid-based drug delivery system, the DOXDT prodrug showed higher drug load capacity up to 23.6%. In addition, excellent stability and smaller size of the nanocarrier contributed to better tissue permeability and tumor suppressive effects in vivo. Hence, this amphipathic DOXDT prodrug is promising in the development of translational DOX formulations, which would be widely applied in cancer therapy.&#169; 2019 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

In vivo anti-cancer studies revealed the effectiveness of CNPs to reduce tumor growth and angiogenesis in melanoma, ovarian, breast and retinoblastoma cancer cell-induced mice, with their conjugation with folic acid, doxorubicin, CPM, or CXC receptor-4 antagonist ligand eliciting higher efficiency. After conjugation with triphenylphosphonium or magnetite nanoparticles, CNPs were shown to combat Alzheimer's disease by reducing amyloid-&#946;, glial fibrillary acidic protein, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in mice. By improving muscle function and longevity, the citrate/EDTA-stabilized CNPs could ameliorate amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also, they could effectively reduce obesity in mice by scavenging ROS and reducing adipogenesis, triglyceride synthesis, GAPDH enzyme activity, leptin and insulin levels. In CCl4-induced rats, stress signaling pathways due to inflammatory cytokines, liver enzymes, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum messengers could be attenuated by CNPs. Commercial CNPs showed protective effects on rats with hepatic ischemia reperfusion and peritonitis-induced hepatic/cardiac injuries by decreasing oxidative stress and hepatic/cardiac inflammation. The same CNPs could improve kidney function by diminishing renal superoxide, hyperglycemia and tubular damage in peritonitis-induced acute kidney injury in rats. Radiation-induced lung and testicular tissue damage could be alleviated in mice, with the former showing improvement in pulmonary distress and bronchoconstriction and the latter exhibiting restoration in spermatogenesis rate and spermatid/spermatocyte number. Through enhancement of gastrointestinal motility, the CNPs could alleviate constipation in both young and old rats. They could also protect rat from light-induced retinal damage by slowing down neurodegenerative process and microglial activation.&#169; 2019 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

What is the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic adenocarcinoma? 3. What are the harms of screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma? 4. Does treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma improve cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, or quality of life? 5. What are the harms of treatment of screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma?We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and PubMed, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. We searched for articles published from 2002 to October 3, 2017, and updated our search on April 27, 2018. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), for relevant ongoing studies.We reviewed 19,596 abstracts and 824 articles against specified inclusion criteria. Eligible studies included those written in English and conducted in adults age 18 years or older with or without risk factors for pancreatic cancer. For key questions on screening, we included imaging-based screening protocols. For key questions on treatment, we included studies of adults with screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.We conducted dual, independent critical appraisal of all provisionally included studies and abstracted study details and results from fair- and good-quality studies. Because of the limited number of studies and the population heterogeneity, we provided a narrative synthesis of results and used summary tables to allow for comparisons across studies. After confirming that the yield of different imaging modalities was similar across studies, we calculated a pooled diagnostic yield across studies and produced forest plots to illustrate the range of effects seen across studies. For harms of screening (KQ3) and harms of treatment (KQ5), we stratified results by procedural and psychosocial harms.We included 13 unique prospective cohort screening studies (24 articles) reporting results for 1,317 people. Studies were conducted in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and all screening populations except one small comparison group were exclusively in persons at elevated familial or genetic risk for pancreatic cancer. No studies reported on the effect of screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma on cancer morbidity, mortality, or all-cause mortality (KQ1); and no studies reported on the effectiveness of treatment for screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KQ4). Thirteen fair quality studies reported on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KQ2). Across these studies, 18 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were detected.. Twelve of 18 cases (66.7%) were detected at stage I or II or classified as &#8220;resectable.&#8221; Pooled yield for all screening tests to detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma on initial screening in high-risk populations was 7.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 14.7); and for total yield including both initial and repeat screening, it was 15.6 per 1000 (95% CI, 9.3 to 24.5). Harms of screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Procedural harms of screening were evaluated in eight screening studies (n=675); psychological harms were assessed in two studies (n=277). Details on the assessment of harms were variably reported. In two studies (n=277) in which 150 individuals received ERCP as a diagnostic followup test, 15 people (10%) reported acute pancreatitis, nine of which required hospitalization. No evidence of increased worry, distress, depression, or anxiety after screening was reported, compared to before screening. Harms of treatment of screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma Of the 57 people who underwent surgery across all studies, six studies (n=32 people receiving surgery) assessed harms of treatment of screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KQ5), with 7 harms detected in two studies. Methods of assessing harms were variably reported. Harms included one person experiencing stricture to the hepaticojejunal anastomosis at 11 months after surgery, one with unspecified post-operative complications, 2 with post-operative fistula and 3 cases of diabetes. In the two studies that systematically assessed harms in all surgical patients (n=12 people receiving surgery), no harms were reported.No randomized trials of screening were identified. The body of evidence includes observational screening studies with limited sample sizes and focused on populations with known familial risk, many with a substantial proportion of people with known genetic mutations. No studies included a clinical followup or unscreened comparison group, limiting assessment of diagnostic accuracy. Of those studies that reported harms of screening or treatment, limitations included inadequate description of the methods of assessing harms, including whether all participants were systematically assessed.Imaging-based screening in groups at high familial risk can detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma with limited evidence of minimal harms. However, the clinical impact of screening is not well documented. There is insufficient evidence to assess benefits or harms of surgical intervention for screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Chemotherapy agents have been widely used for cancer treatment, while the insolubility, instability and toxicity seriously restrict their efficacy. Thus, prodrug strategy was devised. Since some prodrugs are still with poor solubility or stability, a synergy strategy is needed to enhance their efficacy. Gemcitabine (GEM) is a prescribed anticancer drug, however, the rapid clearance, growing resistance and serious side effects limit its clinical efficacy. Conjugating GEM with d-&#945;-tocopherol succinate (TOS) is an effective solution, while the GEM-TOS (GT) is unstable in aqueous solution. d-&#945;-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) has been used to enhance the stability, but GT stabilized by TPGS (GTT) has limited effect on tumor metastases. Tumor metastases lead to high mortality in patients suffering from cancers. In order to further achieve antimetastatic effect, an amphiphilic polymer (LT) was synthesized by connecting low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) with TOS, and eventually obtained desired self-delivery micellar NPs (GLT) by co-assembly GT with LT. The GLT not only possessed excellent stability, but also inhibited the metastases by acting on different phases of the metastatic cascade. The hydrophobic TOS inhibited the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), the hydrophilic LMWH inhibited the interaction between tumor cells and platelets. As a result, GLT reduced tumor cells entering the blood and implanting at the distant organs, leading to a much more excellent inhibitory effect on the lung metastasis than GEM and GTT.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

        "abstract": "For the past several decades, synchrotron radiation has been extensively used to measure the spatial distribution and chemical affinity of elements found in trace concentrations (<few &#956;g/g) in animal and human tissues. Intense and highly focused (lateral size of several micrometers) X-ray beams combined with small steps of photon energy tuning (2-3 eV) of synchrotron radiation allowed X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques to nondestructively and simultaneously detect trace elements as well as identify their chemical affinity and speciation in situ, respectively. Although limited by measurement time and radiation damage to the tissue, these techniques are commonly used to obtain two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps of several elements at synchrotron facilities around the world. The spatial distribution and chemistry of the trace elements obtained is then correlated to the targeted anatomical structures and to the biological functions (normal or pathological). For example, synchrotron-based in vitro studies of various human tissues showed significant differences between the normal and pathological distributions of metallic trace elements such as iron, zinc, copper, and lead in relation to human diseases ranging from Parkinson's disease and cancer to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Current research effort is aimed at not only measuring the abnormal elemental distributions associated with various diseases, but also indicate or discover possible biological mechanisms that could explain such observations. While a number of studies confirmed and strengthened previous knowledge, others revealed or suggested new possible roles of trace elements or provided a more accurate spatial distribution in relation to the underlying histology. This area of research is at the intersection of several current fundamental and applied scientific inquiries such as metabolomics, medicine, biochemistry, toxicology, food science, health physics, and environmental and public health.",

The sensitivity of the test in detecting abnormal cells is 67-75% in various studies. Owing to the volume of smears at cancer screening centres, significant man-hours are expended in the test. We have developed a software program for identification of foci of abnormal cells from conventional smears. We have chosen the convolutional neural network (CNN) model&#160;for its efficacy in image classification.A total of 1838 microphotographs from cervical smears, containing 1301 'normal' foci and 537 'abnormal' foci were included in the study. The data set was split into training, testing and validation sets. A CNN was developed in the Python programming language. The CNN was trained with the training and testing set. At the end of training, 94.64% accuracy was achieved in the testing set. The CNN was then run on the validation set (441 images).The CNN showed 94.28% sensitivity, 96.01% specificity, 91.66% positive predictive value and 97.30% negative predictive value. The CNN could recognise normal squamous cells, overlapping cells, neutrophils and debris and classify the focus appropriately. False positives were reported when the CNN failed to recognise overlapping cells (2.7% microphotographs). It could correctly label cell clusters with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromasia. In 1.8% of microphotographs, a false negative was reported.The CNN showed 95.46% diagnostic accuracy, suggesting potential use in screening.&#169; 2019 Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS).",

To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Huber regression for robust estimation and inference. The key observation is that the robustification parameter should adapt to the sample size, dimension and moments for optimal tradeoff between bias and robustness. Our theoretical framework deals with heavy-tailed distributions with bounded (1 + &#948;)-th moment for any &#948; > 0. We establish a sharp phase transition for robust estimation of regression parameters in both low and high dimensions: when &#948; &#8805; 1, the estimator admits a sub-Gaussian-type deviation bound without sub-Gaussian assumptions on the data, while only a slower rate is available in the regime 0 < &#948; < 1 and the transition is smooth and optimal. In addition, we extend the methodology to allow both heavy-tailed predictors and observation noise. Simulation studies lend further support to the theory. In a genetic study of cancer cell lines that exhibit heavy-tailedness, the proposed methods are shown to be more robust and predictive.",

Design, Setting, and Participants &#8195;Single-center institutional cancer registry was used to retrospectively identify and analyze outcomes for 12 patients treated for ACC of the nasopharynx from 2000 to 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures &#8195;Primary outcomes included 5-year overall survival and locoregional control. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 (STATACorp, College Station, Texas, United States). Spearman's rank order correlation was used for ordinal, monotonic variables with p -values <0.05 considered statistically significant. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method; comparison between groups was performed using log-rank test. Results &#8195;Twelve patients with ACC of the nasopharynx were included. All patients presented with advanced disease and were treated with primary radiation therapy, typically proton beam therapy. Only two underwent a surgical attempt at resection. A majority of cases had a cribriform growth pattern. The 5-year survival was 75% and rate of locoregional control rate at 5 years was 50%, comparable to other ACC cohort studies that included earlier stage tumors in various subsites that were surgically resected. Conclusions &#8195;Although ACC is traditionally noted to be radioresistant, ACC of the nasopharynx was responsive to radiotherapy in our cohort, despite advanced stage and skull base invasion. Reasons for this improved survival are unclear and suggest the need for further pathologic and genetic characterization of nasopharyngeal ACC.&#169; Thieme Medical Publishers.",

        "abstract": "Circadian rhythms regulate many physiological and behavioral processes, including sleep, metabolism and cell division, which have a 24-h oscillation pattern. Rhythmicity is generated by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop in individual cells, which are synchronized by the central pacemaker in the brain and external cues. Epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that disruption of these rhythms can increase both tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Environmental changes (shift work, jet lag, exposure to light at night), mutations in circadian regulating genes, and changes to clock gene expression are recognized forms of disruption and are associated with cancer risk and/or cancer progression. Experimental data in animals and cell cultures further supports the role of the cellular circadian clock in coordinating cell division and DNA repair, and disrupted cellular clocks accelerate cancer cell growth. This review will summarize studies linking circadian disruption to cancer biology and explore how such disruptions may be further altered by common characteristics of tumors including hypoxia and acidosis. We will highlight how circadian rhythms might be exploited for cancer drug development, including how delivery of current chemotherapies may be enhanced using chronotherapy. Understanding the role of circadian rhythms in carcinogenesis and tumor progression will enable us to better understand causes of cancer and how to treat them.&#169; 2019 by the authors.",

        "abstract": "Interest and application of stereotactic radiosurgery for multiple brain metastases continue to increase. Various planning systems are available for linear accelerator (linac)-based single-isocenter multiple metastasis radiosurgery. Two of the most advanced systems are BrainLAB Multiple Metastases Elements (MME), a dynamic conformal arc (DCA) approach, and Varian RapidArc (RA), a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach. In this work, we systematically compared plan quality between the 2 techniques.Thirty patients with 4 to 10 metastases (217 total; median 7.5; Vmin = 0.014 cm3; Vmax = 17.73 cm3) were planned with both Varian RA and MME at 2 different institutions with extensive experience in each respective technique. All plans had a single isocenter and used Varian linac equipped with high-definition multileaf collimator. RA plans used 2 to 4 noncoplanar VMAT arcs with 10 MV flattening filter-free beam. MME plans used 4 to 9 noncoplanar DCAs and 6 MV flattening filter-free beam, (minimum planning target volume [PTVmin] = 0.49 cm3; PTVmax = 27.32 cm3; PTVmedian = 7.05 cm3). Prescriptions were 14 to 24 Gy in a single fraction. Target coverage goal was 99% of volume receiving prescription dose (D99% &#8805; 100%). Plans were evaluated by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Paddick conformity index (CI) score, 12 Gy volume (V12Gy), V8Gy, V5Gy, mean brain dose (Dmean), and beam-on time.Conformity was favorable among RA plans (median: MME CIRTOG = 1.38; RA CIRTOG = 1.21; P < .0001). V12Gy and V8Gy were lower for RA plans (median: MME V12 = 23.7 cm3; RA V12 = 19.2 cm3; P = .0001; median: MME V8Gy = 53.6 cm3; RA V8Gy = 44.1 cm3; P&#160;=&#160;.024).

        "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a quality control framework for intensity modulated radiation therapy plan evaluations that can account for variations in patient- and treatment-specific risk factors.Patient-specific risk factors, such as a patient's anatomy and tumor dose requirements, affect organs-at-risk (OARs) dose-volume histograms (DVHs), which in turn affects plan quality and can potentially cause adverse effects. Treatment-specific risk factors, such as the use of chemotherapy and surgery, are clinically relevant when evaluating radiation therapy planning criteria. A risk-adjusted control chart was developed to identify unusual plan quality after accounting for patient- and treatment-specific risk factors. In this proof of concept, 6 OAR DVH points and average monitor units serve as proxies for plan quality. Eighteen risk factors are considered for modeling quality: planning target volume (PTV) and OAR cross-sectional areas; volumes, spreads, and surface areas; minimum and centroid distances between OARs and the PTV; 6 PTV DVH points; use of chemotherapy; and surgery. A total of 69 head and neck cases were used to demonstrate the application of risk-adjusted control charts, and the results were compared with the application of conventional control charts.The risk-adjusted control chart remains robust to interpatient variations in the studied risk factors, unlike the conventional control chart. For the brainstem, the conventional chart signaled 4 patients with unusual (out-of-control) doses to 2% brainstem volume. However, the adjusted chart did not signal any plans after accounting for their risk factors. For the spinal cord doses to 2% brainstem volume, the conventional chart signaled 2 patients, and the adjusted chart signaled a separate patient after accounting for their risk factors. Similar adjustments were observed for the other DVH points when evaluating brainstem, spinal cord, ipsilateral parotid, and average monitor units. The adjustments can be directly attributed to the patient- and treatment-specific risk factors.A risk-adjusted control chart was developed to evaluate plan quality, which is robust to variations in patient- and treatment-specific parameters.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

Since 2010, a new inventory, the thyroid-specific patient-reported outcome (ThyPRO) measure for benign thyroid disorders, has been available.This study evaluated QoL longitudinally in patients with a history of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) by means of the ThyPRO questionnaire. Methods : From 2012 to 2016, QoL was evaluated yearly in 123 adult DTC patients by means of ThyPRO. The ThyPRO questionnaire consists of 13 scales on which higher scores represent greater impact on QoL in areas affected by thyroid pathology. Disease-specific morbidity due to possible inadequate L-T4 treatment was evaluated by means of the Billewicz scale (BS). The same examinations were conducted in 192 control subjects who had undergone surgery for benign thyroid pathology.DTC and control subjects had similar scores on all but one scale; scores on the hyperthyroid symptoms scale were significantly higher in DTC patients than in controls. Over the 5 years, scores did not change significantly in the DTC group. Overall, QoL and BS scores showed a slight, but not significant, improvement during the study period in DTC patients. BMI impacted on several ThyPRO scales. No significant differences between genders were noted in DTC.The ThyPRO questionnaire indicates that illness perception is similar after thyroidectomy for malign and benign pathology.

In the present work, the regulatory effects of SMI on tumor vasculature were determined, and the potential anti-angiogenic components targeting tumor endothelial cells (TECs) were identified. Multidimensional pharmacokinetic profiles of ginsenosides in plasma, subcutaneous tumors, and TECs were investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of protopanaxadiol-type (PPD) ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2/Rb3, Rc, and Rd) in both plasma and tumors, were higher than those of protopanaxatriol-type (Rg1 and Re) and oleanane-type (Ro) ginsenosides. Among PPD-type ginsenosides, Rd exhibited the greatest concentrations in tumors and TECs after repeated injection. In&#160;vivo bioactivity results showed that Rd suppressed neovascularization in tumors, normalized the structure of tumor vessels, and improved the anti-tumor effect of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in xenograft mice. Furthermore, Rd inhibited the migration and tube formation capacity of endothelial cells in&#160;vitro. In conclusion, Rd may be an important active form to exert the anti-angiogenic effect on tumor after SMI treatment.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

        "abstract": "Phototherapies offer promising alternatives to traditional cancer therapies. Phototherapies mainly rely on manipulation of target tissue through photothermal, photochemical, or photomechanical interactions. Combining phototherapy with immunotherapy has the benefit of eliciting a systemic immune response. Specifically, photothermal therapy (PTT) has been shown to induce apoptosis and necrosis in cancer cells, releasing tumor associated antigenic peptides while sparing healthy host cells, through temperature increase in targeted tissue. However, the tissue temperature must be monitored and controlled to minimize adverse thermal effects on normal tissue and to avoid the destruction of tumor-specific antigens, in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effects of PTT. Techniques for monitoring PTT have evolved from post-treatment quantification methods like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry to modern methods capable of real-time monitoring, such as magnetic resonance thermometry, computed tomography, and photoacoustic imaging. Monitoring methods are largely chosen based on the type of light delivery to the target tissue. Interstitial methods of thermometry, such as thermocouples and fiber-optic sensors, are able to monitor temperature of the local tumor environment. However, these methods can be challenging if the phototherapy itself is interstitially administered. Increasingly, non-invasive therapies call for non-invasive monitoring, which can be achieved through magnetic resonance thermometry, computed tomography, and photoacoustic imaging techniques. The purpose of this review is to introduce the feasible methods used to monitor tissue temperature during PTT. The descriptions of different techniques and the measurement examples can help the researchers and practitioners when using therapeutic PTT.",

Treatment with methotrexate (MTX) was successful, and her RA was in remission. Five weeks before the hospitalisation, she was diagnosed with optic neuritis due to a decline in the visual acuity of the right eye. She was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by prednisolone (PSL), before the hospitalisation, which were not effective. Blood tests showed increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, liver injury, and thrombocytopenia. Abdominal echo revealed numerous enlarged lymph nodes in the hepatic portal region. Malignant lymphoma was suspected due to high serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor. None of the treatments were effective, and she died on the fifth hospital day. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was diagnosed during the autopsy, which showed infiltration of CD20-positive atypical lymphocytes in almost all organs. Since she was taking MTX, she was diagnosed with immunosuppressive drug-associated lymphoproliferative disease (LPD). Anti-human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody was detected in her serum after her death; however, adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma was not observed. LPD develops during the treatment of RA with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs; however, a rapid clinical course leading to death is rarely observed.

Herein, we describe the case of a 66-year-old woman who developed aortitis after administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) during chemotherapy for her breast cancer. Thickening of the aortic wall was clearly detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. After excluding the other possible aetiologies, an association between G-CSF and the development of aortitis was highly suspected. Corticosteroid treatment rapidly regressed the aortitis, as confirmed by follow-up CT examination. G-CSF analog is generally well tolerated; however, there are limited case reports of G-CSF-associated aortitis, suggesting the causative effect of G-CSF in the development of aortitis. Currently, G-CSF-associated aortitis has received little attention among rheumatologists. As the delayed diagnosis results in irreversible changes in the aorta, not only oncologists but also rheumatologists should be aware of this unrecognized disease entity, G-CSF-associated aortitis.",

She was treated with high-dose prednisolone (PSL) and soon developed the symptoms of CS. When she was 25&#160;years old, we evaluated her serum glucocorticoid level while she continued to take oral PSL. The result suggested her CS was affected by both the oral PSL and the endogenous cortisol secreted by the adrenocortical adenoma, which was therefore resected. Seven months after the operation, the patient's body weight was decreasing, and her SLE remained in clinical remission. CS complicated by SLE is rare, and the decision to surgically remove an adrenal tumor in such a case is even more rare.",

Since the description of AL involving temporal arteries in 1986, this disorder has been known as one of the differential diagnoses of giant cell arteritis (GCA). We encountered a case of an elderly female presenting with headache and tender and enlarged temporal arteries, that was pathologically diagnosed with temporal artery involvement of AL due to Bence-Jones-type MM. To our knowledge, this was the first case of AL with temporal artery involvement in Japan, that presented with GCA-like features. Literature review of AL cases with temporal artery involvement showed close similarity between these disorders, but suggested that vasculature involvement (extremity claudication, kidney or heart), macroglossia, carpal tunnel syndrome and normal or low (<0.5&#8201;mg/dL) CRP levels may predict AL rather than GCA. Physicians should keep in mind that AL involving temporal arteries can be a pitfall in the diagnosis of GCA, as seen in our and previous cases.",

The primary outcome was change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to the end of trial. Other outcomes of interest were measures of LV size, strain, and diastolic function. Pooled estimates for each outcome were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) and weighted mean difference (WMD) between the neurohormonal therapy and placebo groups using random effects models.We included 17 trials, collectively enrolling 1,984 participants. In pooled analysis, neurohormonal therapy (vs. placebo) was associated with significantly higher LVEF on follow-up [SMD(95% CI): +1.04(0.57 to 1.50)] but with significant heterogeneity in the pooled estimate (I2 = 96%). Compared with placebo-treated patients, those randomized to neurohormonal therapies experienced a 3.96% (95%CI: 2.9% to 5.0%) less decline in LVEF estimated by WMD, but with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98%). There was a trend towards lower adverse clinical events with neurohormonal therapy (vs. placebo) without statistical significance [risk ratio(95%CI): 0.80(0.53-1.20) I2 = 71%].Neurohormonal therapies are associated with higher LVEF in follow-up among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, although absolute changes in LVEF are small and may be within inter-test variability. Furthermore, significant heterogeneity is observed in the treatment effects across studies highlighting the need for larger trials of cardioprotective strategies.",

        "abstract": "We report on the clinical performance of a fully automated approach to treatment planning based on a Pareto optimal, constrained hierarchical optimization algorithm, named Expedited Constrained Hierarchical Optimization (ECHO).From April 2017 to October 2018, ECHO produced 640 treated plans for 523 patients who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (RT) for paraspinal and other metastatic tumors. A total of 182 plans were for 24 Gy in a single fraction, 387 plans were for 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and the remainder were for other prescriptions or fractionations. Of the plans, 84.5% were for paraspinal tumors, with 69, 302, and 170 in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral spine, respectively. For each case, after contouring, a template plan using 9 intensity modulated RT fields based on disease site and tumor location was sent to ECHO through an application program interface plug-in from the treatment planning system. ECHO returned a plan that satisfied all critical structure hard constraints with optimal target volume coverage and the lowest achievable normal tissue doses. Upon ECHO completion, the planner received an e-mail indicating the plan was ready for review. The plan was accepted if all clinical criteria were met. Otherwise, a limited number of parameters could be adjusted for another ECHO run.The median planning target volume size was 84.3 cm3 (range, 6.9-633.2). The median time to produce 1 ECHO plan was 63.5 minutes (range, 11-340 minutes) and was largely dependent on the field sizes. Of the cases, 79.7% required 1 run to produce a clinically accepted plan, 13.3% required 1 additional run with minimal parameter adjustments, and 7.0% required &#8805;2 additional runs with significant parameter modifications. All plans met or bettered the institutional clinical criteria.We successfully implemented automated stereotactic body RT paraspinal and other metastatic tumors planning. ECHO produced high-quality plans, improved planning efficiency and robustness, and enabled expedited treatment planning at our clinic.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "To propose a method of optimizing intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans robust against dosimetric degradation caused by random anatomic variations during treatment.Fifteen patients with prostate cancer treated with IMPT to the pelvic targets were nonrandomly selected. On the repeated quality assurance computed tomography (QACTs) for some patients, bowel density changes were observed and caused dose degradation because the treated plans were not robustly optimized (non-RO). To mitigate this effect, we developed a robust planning method based on 3 CT images, including the native planning CT and its 2 copies, with the bowel structures being assigned to air and tissue, respectively. The RO settings included 5 mm setup uncertainty and 3.5% range uncertainty on 3 CTs. This method is called pseudomultiple-CT RO (pMCT-RO). Plans were also generated using RO on the native CT only, with the same setup and range uncertainties. This method is referred to as single-CT RO (SCT-RO). Doses on the QACTs and the nominal planning CT were compared for the 3 planning methods.All 3 plan methods provided sufficient clinical target volumes D95% and V95% on the QACTs. For pMCT-RO plans, the normal tissue Dmax on QACTs of all patients was at maximum 109.1%, compared with 144.4% and 116.9% for non-RO and SCT-RO plans, respectively. On the nominal plans, the rectum and bladder doses were similar among all 3 plans; however, the volume of normal tissue (excluding the rectum and bladder) receiving the prescription dose or higher is substantially reduced in either pMCT-RO plans or SCT-RO plans, compared with the non-RO plans.We developed a robust optimization method to further mitigate undesired dose heterogeneity caused by random anatomic changes in pelvic IMPT treatment. This method does not require additional patient CT scans. The pMCT-RO planning method has been implemented clinically since 2017 in our center.&#169; 2020 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "Human exposure to persistent environmental pollutants often results in concentrations with a range of values below the laboratory detection limits. Growing evidence suggests that inadequate handling of concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) may bias assessment of health effects in relation to environmental exposures. We seek to quantify such bias in models focusing on the day-specific probability of pregnancy during the fertile window and propose a model-based approach to reduce such bias. A multivariate skewed generalized t-distribution constrained by the LOD is assumed for the chemical concentrations, which realistically represents the underlying distribution. A latent variable-based framework is used to model fecundibility, which nonlinearly relates conception probability to chemical concentrations, daily intercourses, and other important covariates. The advantages of the proposed approach include the use of multiple chemical concentrations to aid the estimation of left censored chemical exposures, as well as the model-based feedback mechanism for fecundibility outcome to inform the estimations, and an adequate handling of model uncertainty through a joint modeling framework. A Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is developed for implementing the Bayesian computations and the logarithm of pseudo-marginal likelihood measure is used for model choices. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach and apply the framework to the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment study which evaluates the effects of exposures to environmental pollutants on the probability of pregnancy. We found that p,p'-DDT is negatively associated with the day-specific probability of pregnancy.",

This study was undertaken to review our experience in chest wall reconstruction during the past 12&#160;years and to stress upon the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to this complex problem.After obtaining the necessary clearance from institutional ethics committee, we did a retrospective review of all case records of chest wall reconstructions (CWR) performed in our institution during a 12-year period from May 2005 to September 2016. Patient characteristics, co-morbidities, operative data and post-operative complications and outcomes were reviewed.During the study period, a total of 32 patients underwent CWR. All patients were assessed, planned, operated and managed by a team consisting of thoracic surgeons, plastic surgeons, intensivists and pulmonologists. Patients were in the age group of 14-72 with a male:female ratio of 15:17. Indications for CWR were neoplasms (n&#8201;=&#8201;13-40.62%), post-sternotomy wound dehiscence (n&#8201;=&#8201;12-37.5%), osteoradionecrosis (n&#8201;=&#8201;4-12.5%), tuberculosis (n&#8201;=&#8201;2-6.25%) and osteomyelitis rib (1/32-3.125%).

Among these three groups, there were no significant differences in age, maximum standardized uptake value of fluoro-deoxyglucose, laboratory data, or radiological findings. However, in comparison with the cancer recurrence cases, the proportion of patients who had undergone segmentectomy as initial surgery was significantly higher in the granuloma group. Moreover, in five patients in the granuloma group, mycobacterium was detected.It seemed difficult to differentiate between cancer recurrence and granuloma on the basis of radiological examination and laboratory findings. However, if a mass shadow around the staple line appeared after segmentectomy, the mass is likely to be a granuloma.

Research shows that most patients prefer a shared decision-making (SDM) approach as it provides them with the opportunity to be actively involved in their treatment decisions. The current engagement of these patients in their clinical decisions is suboptimal. Moreover, implementing SDM into routine clinical care can be challenging as patients may not always feel adequately prepared or may not expect to be involved in the decision-making process.Avalere Health developed the Preparation for Shared Decision-Making (PFSDM) tool to help patients with ABC feel prepared to communicate with their clinicians and engage in decision making aligned with their preferences. The goal of this study was to validate the tool for its acceptability and usability among this patient population.We interviewed a diverse group of women with ABC (N=30). Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and double coded by using NVivo. We assessed 8 themes to understand the acceptability and usability of the tool.Interviewees expressed that the tool was acceptable for preparing patients for decision making and would be useful for helping patients know what to expect in their care journey. Interviewees also provided useful comments to improve the tool.This validation study confirms the acceptability and usability of the PFSDM tool for women with ABC.

Here, a fucoidan/poly-lysine-functionalized layer-by-layer ginger-derived lipid vector (LbL-GDLV) was designed to target P-selectin (overexpressed by endothelial cells) and deliver a loaded drug into vascularized colon cancer. In vitro, LbL-GDLVs selectively bound to P-selectin, and the degradation of the fucoidan outer layer in a milieu similar to the cancer microenvironment resulted in rapid attachment of the cancer cell and internalization of the remaining positively charged poly-lysine coated-GDLVs. Upon enzymolysis of the poly-lysine layer inside the cancer cell, the GDLV core released loaded doxorubicin (Dox) which had the expected effects. In vivo bio-distribution studies showed that intravenously injected LbL-GDLVs exhibited enhanced accumulation at the vascularized tumor site (~ 4.4-fold higher than control vesicles), presumably due to P-selectin-mediated targeting plus the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). In two animal models used to screen anti-cancer efficacy (Luc-HT-29 and HCT-116 xenografts), Dox-loaded LbL-GDLVs (LbL-GDLVs/Dox) significantly inhibited tumor growth and demonstrated much better therapeutic efficiency than free Dox. More importantly, LbL-GDLVs/Dox exhibited excellent biocompatibility, and LbL-GDLVs encapsulation largely reduced the cardiotoxicity of free Dox and avoided the notorious drug resistance of colon cells against free Dox. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of our newly designed and highly biocompatible plant-derived LbL nanoparticles and their precise colon cancer drug delivery function.",

Worry about lung cancer1 is an indicator of perceived risk2 and is related to interest in cessation and cancer screening.The analysis sought to explore underlying relationships among worry about lung cancer, smoking-related disease risk perceptions, and numeracy in a web-based panel.A Web-based survey, including a numeracy measure, was completed by 1,682 participants aged 18-65 recruited in 2014. Former and current smokers were asked about LC worry and current smokers were asked their PR of diseases associated with smoking.Females (m=25.64, 95% CI [24.67, 26.61]), respondents aged 45-65 (m=26.15, 95% CI [24.89, 27.41]), those who worry \"all the time\" about LC (m=27.62, 95% CI [25.66, 29.58]), and respondents perceiving a higher risk of LC compared to other smokers (m=28.84, 95% CI [27.66, 30.01]) expressed significantly higher PR means. Higher household income (OR=1.20, 95% CI [1.08, 1.34]), age (OR=0.86, 95% CI [0.77, 0.98]), and comparative LC risk (OR=2.52, 95% CI [2.01, 3.17]) were significantly associated with greater worry about LC. As PR increases by one unit, the probability of worrying increases by 4.6%. For numeracy scores, odds ratio showed that as scores increased by one unit, the probability of worrying decreased by 11.9%.In this study, we have shown that PR has a positive association with LC worry and that numeracy has a negative association with LC worry.This information can be used to target subpopulations with low PR and numeracy about their risks for lung cancer and to develop tailored messages to educate these people.",

        "abstract": "The combination of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-involved photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) holds great promise for enhancing ROS-mediated cancer treatment. Herein, we reported an in situ polymerized hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle (HMON) biocatalysis nanoreactor to integrate the synergistic effect of PDT/CDT for enhancing ROS-mediated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment. HPPH photosensitizer was hybridized within the framework of HMON via an \"in situ framework growth\" approach. Then, the hollow cavity of HMONs was exploited as a nanoreactor for \"in situ polymerization\" to synthesize the polymer containing thiol groups, thereby enabling the immobilization of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles, which behave like glucose oxidase-like nanozyme, converting glucose into H2O2 to provide self-supplied H2O2 for CDT. Meanwhile, Cu2+-tannic acid complexes were further deposited on the surface of HMONs (HMON-Au@Cu-TA) to initiate Fenton-like reaction to covert the self-supplied H2O2 into &#8226;OH, a highly toxic ROS. Finally, collagenase (Col), which can degrade the collagen I fiber in the extracellular matrix (ECM), was loaded into HMON-Au@Cu-TA to enhance the penetration of HMONs and O2 infiltration for enhanced PDT. This study provides a good paradigm for enhancing ROS-mediated anti-tumor efficacy. Meanwhile, this research offers a new method to broaden the application of silica based nanotheranostics.",

Here, the development and evaluation of biodegradable near-infrared fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FSN) is described that have the potential to improve adenoma detection during fluorescence-assisted white-light colonoscopic surveillance in rodent and human-scale models of colorectal carcinogenesis. FSNs are biodegradable (t1/2 of 2.7 weeks), well-tolerated, and enable detection and delineation of adenomas as small as 0.5 mm2 with high tumor-to-background ratios. Furthermore, in the human-scale, APC 1311/+ porcine model, the clinical feasibility and benefit of using FSN-guided detection of colorectal adenomas using video-rate fluorescence-assisted white-light endoscopy is demonstrated. Since nanoparticles of similar size (e.g., 100-150-nm) or composition (i.e., silica, silica/gold hybrid) have already been successfully translated to the clinic, and, clinical fluorescent/white light endoscopy systems are becoming more readily available, there is a viable path towards clinical translation of the proposed strategy for early colorectal cancer detection and prevention in high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Clinical application of drug cocktails for cancer therapy is limited by their severe systemic toxicity. To solve a catch-22 dilemma between safety and efficacy for drug cocktails, a hetero-targeted nano-cocktail (PPPDMA) with traceless linkers has been developed. In the PPPDMA nanogel, a hetero-targeting strategy is employed to improve its tumor selective targeting efficacy by overcoming the cancer cell mono-ligand density limitation. Benefit from its glutathione and reactive oxygen species responsiveness, the loaded paclitaxel and doxorubicin can be quickly and tracelessly released into the cytoplasm in their original form, which bestows PPPDMA nanogels the capability to overwhelm the processing capacity of cancer cell's P-glycoprotein efflux pump allows, and ultimately kill them without inducing side effects. The PPPDMA treatment reduced its tumor burden over 99% (in tumor weight) and 96% (in tumor number). Most importantly, no detectable tumor in more than half of the PPPDMA treated mice. We conclude that traceless linker and hetero-targeted nano-cocktail strategy could be a safe and effective approach for cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis use is more common among individuals with chronic pain, and is often used to relieve physical discomfort. However, little is known about factors that are associated with cannabis use among individuals with chronic pain, and there is reason to suspect that perceptions of discomfort intolerance (DI) play an important role in pain-cannabis relations. The goal of this study was to conduct an initial examination of perceived DI, pain severity, and pain-related interference in relation to frequency of cannabis use among individuals with chronic pain. Specifically, we hypothesized that pain severity/interference and factors of DI (avoidance and intolerance), would each be positively associated with cannabis use frequency. Participants (N = 109; 44% male; M age = 27) endorsed chronic pain and at least one instance of lifetime cannabis use. Most participants characterized their chronic pain as high intensity and low disability, and the two most commonly reported frequencies of cannabis use were \"less than monthly\" (n = 38), and \"daily/almost daily\" (n = 32). Results indicated that discomfort avoidance (but not discomfort intolerance), pain severity, and pain-related interference were each independently and positively associated with frequency of cannabis use. These preliminary findings suggest that continued examination of perceived discomfort avoidance in relation to co-occurring pain and cannabis use is warranted. Future research should replicate these results among treatment-seeking pain patients who are prescribed medical cannabis.",

        "abstract": "Studying the effects of groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as in a gene, genetic pathway, or network, can provide novel insight into complex diseases like breast cancer, uncovering new genetic associations and augmenting the information that can be gleaned from studying SNPs individually. Common challenges in set-based genetic association testing include weak effect sizes, correlation between SNPs in a SNP-set, and scarcity of signals, with individual SNP effects often ranging from extremely sparse to moderately sparse in number. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for the association between a SNP-set and outcome. The GBJ extends the Berk-Jones statistic by accounting for correlation among SNPs, and it provides advantages over the Generalized Higher Criticism test when signals in a SNP-set are moderately sparse. We also provide an analytic p-value calculation for SNP-sets of any finite size, and we develop an omnibus statistic that is robust to the degree of signal sparsity. An additional advantage of our work is the ability to conduct inference using individual SNP summary statistics from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We evaluate the finite sample performance of the GBJ through simulation and apply the method to identify breast cancer risk genes in a GWAS conducted by the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility Consortium. Our results suggest evidence of association between FGFR2 and breast cancer and also identify other potential susceptibility genes, complementing conventional SNP-level analysis.",

The estimated likelihood approach, which separates the estimation of biomarker distribution from the maximization of the estimated likelihood, has often been adopted. Here we develop a likelihood-based approach that jointly estimates the two parts and describe the methods for selecting auxiliary variables as risk predictors and/or biomarker predictors. Through numerical studies, we observe that in a standard trial design without a CPV component, the two methods achieve similar performance in estimation of the risk model and the marker model. However, for trials augmented with a CPV component, using the likelihood-based method achieves better estimation performance compared to the estimated likelihood method. Moreover, in the presence of a large number of covariates from which to select, the ML method achieves comparable or better performance compared to the EL method in both designs. While the CPV component has not yet been implemented in existing vaccine trials, our results have applications in the planning of future vaccine trials.

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in western countries. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays key roles in the development of PCa. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the standard therapy for advanced PCa. In addition to its ligand androgen, accumulating evidence indicates that posttranscriptional modification is another important mechanism to regulate AR activities during the progression of PCa, especially in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To date, a number of posttranscriptional modifications of AR have been identified, including phosphorylation (e.g. by CDK1), acetylation (e.g. by p300 and recognized by BRD4), methylation (e.g. by EZH2), ubiquitination (e.g. by SPOP), and SUMOylation (e.g. by PIAS1). These modifications are essential for the maintenance of protein stability, nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of AR. This review summarizes posttranslational modifications that influence androgen-dependent and -independent activities of AR, PCa progression and therapy resistance. We further emphasize that in addition to androgen, posttranslational modification is another important way to regulate AR activity, suggesting that targeting AR posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) of AR, represents a potential and promising alternate for effective treatment of CRPC. Potential areas to be investigated in the future in the field of AR posttranslational modifications are also discussed.&#169; 2020 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

        "abstract": "Gene fusions are established oncogenic drivers and emerging therapeutic targets in advanced colorectal cancer. This study aimed to detail the frequencies and clinicopathological features of gene fusions in colorectal cancer using a circulating tumor DNA assay.Circulating tumor DNA samples in patients with advanced colorectal cancer were analyzed at 4,581 unique time points using a validated plasma-based multigene assay that includes assessment of fusions in FGFR2, FGFR3, RET, ALK, NTRK1, and ROS1. Associations between fusions and clinicopathological features were measured using Fisher's exact test. Relative frequencies of genomic alterations were compared between fusion-present and fusion-absent cases using an unpaired t test.Forty-four unique fusions were identified in 40 (1.1%) of the 3,808 patients with circulating tumor DNA detected: RET (n = 6; 36% of all fusions detected), FGFR3 (n = 2; 27%), ALK (n = 10, 23%), NTRK1 (n = 3; 7%), ROS1 (n = 2; 5%), and FGFR2 (n = 1; 2%). Relative to nonfusion variants detected, fusions were more likely to be subclonal (odds ratio, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.94 to 23.00; P < .001). Mutations associated with a previously reported anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapy resistance signature (subclonal RAS and EGFR mutations) were found with fusions in FGFR3 (10 of 12 patients), RET (nine of 16 patients), and ALK (seven of 10 patients). For the 27 patients with available clinical histories, 21 (78%) had EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment before fusion detection.Diverse and potentially actionable fusions can be detected using a circulating tumor DNA assay in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Distribution of coexisting subclonal mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and NRAS in a subset of the patients with fusion-present colorectal cancer suggests that these fusions may arise as a novel mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that almost any sample of patients with a particular disease is heterogeneous, most clinical trial designs ignore the possibility that treatment or dose effects may differ between prognostic or biologically defined subgroups. This article reviews two clinical trial designs that make subgroup-specific decisions and compares each to a simpler design that ignores patient heterogeneity. The purpose is to illustrate the benefits of accounting prospectively for treatment-subgroup interactions and how utilities may be used to quantify risk-benefit trade-offs.Two Bayesian clinical trial designs that perform subgroup-specific decision making and inference based on elicited utilities of patient outcomes are reviewed. The first is a randomized comparative trial of nutritional prehabilitation for patients undergoing esophageal resection that has two prognostic subgroups and is based on postoperative morbidity score. The second is a sequentially adaptive trial of natural killer cells for treating hematologic malignancies that is based on five time-to-event outcomes and that performs safety monitoring and optimizes cell dose within six disease subgroups. Computer simulations under a range of different scenarios are presented for each design to establish its operating characteristics and compare it to a more conventional design that ignores patient heterogeneity.Each design has attractive operating characteristics, is greatly superior to a simplified design that ignores patient subgroups, is robust to deviations from its assumed statistical model, and is feasible to use for conducting trials.Bayesian designs that make subgroup-specific decisions in randomized comparative trials or sequentially adaptive early-phase dose-finding trials are superior to designs that ignore patient heterogeneity. Using elicited utilities of complex patient outcomes to quantify risk-benefit trade-offs provides a practical and ethical basis for decision making and treatment evaluation in clinical trials.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

DNA was extracted from cervical smears of 20 cases and 30 controls. The DNA was bisulphite modified. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) was performed to assess the methylation status of the promoter region of each of the genes. MSP results were compared with PAP smears to assess the utility of DNA methylation of these genes in screening for cervical cancer. DNA methylation was detected in 55% subjects in p15 gene, 45% in p16 gene and 40% in E-Cadherin&#160;gene. This was statistically significant when compared to the controls. DNA methylation of E-Cadherin, and p15 genes as a panel has a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 90% respectively, which is better than the sensitivity of PAP smear for detection of early cancer cervix. Increased DNA methylation is seen in p15, p16 and E-Cadherin genes in early cancer cervix. p15 and E-Cadherin in combination can be used as a screening tool for detection of early cancer cervix.&#169; Association of Clinical Biochemists of India 2019.",

To improve replicability, we introduce a novel approach to select gene signatures from multiple datasets whose effects are consistently non-zero and account for between-study heterogeneity. We build our model upon some rank-based quantities, facilitating integration over different genomic datasets. A high dimensional penalized Generalized Linear Mixed Model (pGLMM) is used to select gene signatures and address data heterogeneity. We compare our method to some commonly used strategies that select gene signatures ignoring between-study heterogeneity. We provide asymptotic results justifying the performance of our method and demonstrate its advantage in the presence of heterogeneity through thorough simulation studies.

The need to understand the underlying mechanisms of immunotherapies and to develop precision immunotherapy regimens has spurred great interest in characterizing immune cell composition within the tumor microenvironment. Several methods have been developed to estimate immune cell composition using gene expression data from bulk tumor samples. However, these methods are not flexible enough to handle aberrant patterns of gene expression data, e.g., inconsistent cell type-specific gene expression between purified reference samples and tumor samples. We propose a novel statistical method for expression deconvolution called ICeD-T (Immune Cell Deconvolution in Tumor tissues). ICeD-T automatically identifies aberrant genes whose expression are inconsistent with the deconvolution model and down-weights their contributions to cell type abundance estimates. We evaluated the performance of ICeD-T versus existing methods in simulation studies and several real data analyses. ICeD-T displayed comparable or superior performance to these competing methods. Applying these methods to assess the relationship between immunotherapy response and immune cell composition, ICeD-T is able to identify significant associations that are missed by its competitors.",

The outcome of interest was all-cause 30-day readmission. Reasons for readmission were grouped into clinical associated categories. Hierarchical regression model was used for examining the relationship between risk factors and readmission.The 30-day readmission rate was 20.95%. The most common reason for readmission was surgery-related complication. In descriptive analyses, age, certain comorbidities, number of chronic conditions, mortality risk, severity of illness, living at large metropolitan area, resident of the state where patients received initial care, postoperative complication, length of stay, discharge location, and receiving care at the hospitals in large metropolitan area were predictive of readmission. In multivariable analysis, age, depression, peripheral vascular disorder, mortality risk, and discharge location were independently associated with readmission. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.41 for hierarchical regression model.Readmission after pancreatic surgery remains an important issue. Our study found the majority of variation in readmissions is accounted for by patient factors whereas there was little between hospital variation.

In Mexico, more than 20% of open population, present allergic symptoms with notable increase in the last twenty years, especially in children. The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS, according to its initials in Spanish) provides attention to around 7000 patients per year, mainly due to allergies deriving from therapeutic drugs and certain foods. Pharmacotherapy has been effective in reducing classical allergy symptoms, although treatment does not stop disease progression. In addition, the constant use of drugs represents a remarkable socioeconomic impact. Strategies based on the modification of immune responses in the course of allergic reactions through immunotherapy started more than 100 years ago, and some have provided cure to the disease. On the occasion of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2018, it was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their contributions in the regulation of the immune system against cancer, through a new generation of immunotherapy. In this review we analyzed current immunotherapeutic options, including its benefits, limitations and perspectives for the best clinical management of allergies.",

        "abstract": "Adherence to hormonal therapy (HT) treatment is a complex and multifaceted issue that can determine variations in response to treatment. However, it is little known about it in routine clinical practice.To assess adherence to HT from 1 to 5 years of 190 patients treated at the Hospital de Cl&#237;nicas (in Montevideo, Uruguay), and to identify factors for the interruption of therapy.190 patients treated with HT due to S I-III breast cancer were included from 2002 to 2012. The Kaplan Meier method was used to assess the proportion of patients who discontinued HT, and the univariate analysis with log-rank test was used to identify factors leading to its interruption.Out of 190 patients enrolled in the study, 95.3, 87.9, 80.6, 76.4, and 69.5% were still complying with their HT by the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year, respectively. Therapy continuity was greater in patients who received HT combined with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors vs. those who received a single drug (p = 0.017).This real-life evaluation showed that HT adherence was reduced by 30.5% at 5 years, despite that there is a well-known benefit of this treatment on overall survival (OS), that it is well-tolerated, and provided for free. In view of the significant impact that HT interruption may have on OS, further investigation is required to determine what cause patients to discontinue their HT, in order to guide our efforts and enable us to increase and optimize adherence.",

        "abstract": "Novel optical imaging modalities are under development with the goal of obtaining an \"optical biopsy\" to efficiently provide pathologic details. One such modality is confocal microscopy which allows in situ visualization of cells within a layer of tissue and imaging of cellular-level structures. The goal of this study is to validate the ability of confocal microscopy to quickly and accurately differentiate between normal renal tissue and cancer.Specimens were obtained from patients who underwent robotic partial nephrectomy for renal mass. Samples of suspected normal and tumor tissue were extracted from the excised portion of the kidney and stained with acridine orange. The stained samples were imaged on a Nikon E600 C1 Confocal Microscope. The samples were then submitted for hematoxylin and eosin processing and read by an expert pathologist to provide a gold-standard diagnosis that can later be compared to the confocal images.This study included 11 patients, 17 tissue samples, and 118 confocal images. Of the 17 tissue samples, 10 had a gold-standard diagnosis of cancer and seven were benign. Of 118 confocal images, 66 had a gold-standard diagnosis of cancer and 52 were benign. Six confocal images were used as a training set to train eight observers. The observers were asked to rate the test images on a six point scale and the results were analyzed using a web based receiver operating characteristic curve calculator. The average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the empirical receiver operating characteristic curve for this study were 91%, 98%, 81%, and 0.94 respectively.This preliminary study suggest that confocal microscopy can be used to distinguish cancer from normal tissue with high sensitivity and specificity. The observers in this study were trained quickly and on only six images. We expect even higher performance as observers become more familiar with the confocal images.&#169; 2020 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.",

Estimated annual proportion change methodology (EAPC), multivariable logistic regression models, cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing risks regression models were used.The rates of testis-PL, renal-PL, bladder-PL and prostate-PL were 3.04%, 0.22%, 0.18% and 0.01%, respectively. Patients with PGUL were older and more frequently Caucasian. Annual rates significantly decreased for renal-PL (EAPC: -5.6%; p=0.004) and prostate-PL (EAPC: -3.6%; p=0.03). In multivariable logistic regression models, older ager independently predicted testis-PL (odds ratio [OR]: 16.4; p<0.001) and renal-PL (OR: 3.5; p<0.001), while female gender independently predicted bladder-PL (OR: 5.5; p<0.001). In surgically treated patients, cumulative incidence plots showed significantly higher 10-year cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates for testis-PL, renal-PL and prostate-PL versus their primary genitourinary tumors. In multivariable competing risks regression models, only testis-PL (hazard ratio [HR]: 16.7; p<0.001) and renal-PL (HR: 2.52; p<0.001) independently predicted higher CSM rates.PGUL rates are extremely low and on the decrease in kidney and prostate but stable in testis and bladder. Relative to primary genitourinary tumors, PGUL are associated with worse CSM for testis-PL and renal-PL but not for bladder-PL and prostate-PL, even after adjustment for other-cause mortality.&#169; 2020 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

        "abstract": "The benefits of genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) are well documented; however, Black women are less likely to use these services compared to White women. Mistrust of the medical system has been associated with Black women's use of genetic counseling and testing (GCT). However, relatively little is known about the correlates of medical mistrust in Black women at increased risk of HBOC. In this study, we examined the prevalence and predictors of medical mistrust in 94 Black women at-risk of HBOC. Most women were married (48.7%) and had at least some collegiate education (57.1%). While no predisposing characteristics were significantly related to medical mistrust, bivariate analysis indicated significant relationships between mistrust and fatalism (p=0.04), perceptions of discrimination in the healthcare setting (p=0.01), and self-efficacy in obtaining GCT (p=0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed that women who reported more discriminatory experiences and women with less confidence in obtaining GCT expressed greater medical mistrust. Multilevel approaches are needed to address psychosocial factors associated with feelings of mistrust. Future efforts must not solely focus on educating women on the importance of and need for GCT; addressing structural barriers, such as patient-provider interactions, that contribute to mistrust must become a priority.",

In our recent study, we tested topically applied ascorbic acid to treat basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and achieved a good clinical response.Based on these results, we decided to examine the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid (IVA) for locally advanced BCC.In this pilot study, patients diagnosed with locally advanced BCC who were not amenable to radiation, surgical or local therapy (no other treatment option was available at the time) received intravenous ascorbic acid (1-1.8 g/kg), in an outpatient setting, 1-3 times per week for a mean duration of 42 &#177;23.6 weeks. This therapy was generally well tolerated.Among 4 patients who had a total of 165 (mean: 41 &#177;51, range: 1-114) skin lesions, 3 patients achieved stable disease and one had progressive disease. There was substantial variability in individual tumor response to therapy. With the aid of two-photon microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging techniques, alterations in collagen structure were observed between tumor nests during IVA therapy.Our results suggest that IVA is well tolerated in a small group of patients with extensive BCCs. However, in the era of smoothened (Smo) receptor inhibitors, it may only be considered as an adjuvant therapy in treatment-resistant cases.Copyright: &#169; 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.",

One common side effect of VEGFi therapy is elevated blood pressure. Evidence suggests that the RAAS may be involved in VEGFi-mediated increases in blood pressure.This retrospective cohort analysis was performed using a de-identified version of the electronic health record at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Subjects with cancer who were exposed to VEGFi therapy were identified, and blood pressure and medication data were extracted. Changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in response to VEGFi therapy in patients receiving RAAS inhibitor (RAASi) therapy before VEGFi initiation were compared with changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients not receiving RAASi therapy before VEGFi initiation.Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure rose in both groups after VEGFi use; however, patients who had RAASi therapy before VEGFi initiation had a significantly lower increase in systolic blood pressure as compared with patients with no RAASi therapy (2.46 mm Hg [95% confidence interval: 0.7 to 4.2] compared with 4.56 mm Hg [95% confidence interval: 3.5 to 5.6], respectively; p = 0.034).In a real-world clinical population, RAASi therapy before VEGFi initiation may ameliorate VEGFi-mediated increases in blood pressure. Randomized clinical trials are needed to further our understanding of the role of RAASi therapy in VEGFi-mediated increases in blood pressure. (J Am Coll Cardiol CardioOnc 2019;1:14-23).",

        "abstract": "Interprofessional collaboration is vital to maintain a successful healthcare team. We describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of an interprofessional educational curriculum on a large inpatient, acute care pediatric unit. Our objective was to improve attitudes towards collaborative care and collegial relations between staff nurses and pediatric medical residents. Nurses and residents participated in several interventions including a video for the nurses, a video for the residents, a team-building exercise, and three interprofessional clinical simulations. Participants' attitudes toward collaborative care were evaluated by a self-reported questionnaire, adapted from several validated survey instruments, before and after the intervention. Each question was mapped to one of the four domains of interprofessional practice: Teams and Teamwork, Interprofessional Communication, Values and Ethics for Interprofessional Practice, and Roles and Responsibilities. The National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators - Practice Environment Scale (NDNQI-PES) question on collegial nurse and physician relations was also queried to corroborate these findings. There was a statistically significant improvement in the nurses' response to 7/24 (29%) survey questions, of which 4 were within the domain of Teams and Teamwork. There was a statistically significant improvement in the residents' response to 5/24 (21%) questions, of which 3 fell within the domain of Interprofessional Communication. None of the survey questions demonstrated a statistically significant decrease. There was also an improvement on NDNQI-PES scores for the target unit, both during and immediately following the intervention. In conclusion, this educational curriculum involving nurses and residents led to improved participants' attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration.",

We hypothesized that viewing the online video would improve attitudes about hypnosis. Using a repeated measures design, total attitudes toward hypnosis improved following the lecture [F(1,339) = 321.97, p < .0001], as did all hypnosis attitude subscales. Older age and ethnicity (Latino/a) were associated with more positive attitudes across assessment points (ps < .05). Those trainees without prior hypnosis experience had the most attitude improvement (p < .05). The results support the use of a brief, online hypnosis lecture to improve cancer care provider attitudes about hypnosis, and suggest a path forward to facilitate more widespread dissemination of hypnosis to cancer care.",

We investigated the survival impact of local treatment of metastases as a first-line treatment after metastasis in HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients with a very low metastatic volume.From a retrospectively constructed database for three institutes, we identified HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients with recurrent distant oligometastatic disease after initially curative treatment. De novo stage 4 patients were excluded, and only those with recurrent metastatic disease were included. Oligometastatic disease was defined as follows: (1) &#8804;2 metastatic lesions in a single organ, (2) a maximal diameter &#8804;3 cm, and (3) organ involvement, including the lung, liver, adrenal gland, bone, or distant lymph nodes. Local treatment comprised surgery or radiotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated.Forty-nine patients were included; 33 underwent local treatment. Of these 33 patients, 5 underwent surgical resection and 27 received radiotherapy. One patient underwent both surgical resection and radiotherapy. Median PFS was significantly longer among the patients with local treatment than among the patients without local treatment (30.0 vs. 18.0 months, p = 0.049). In multivariate analysis, local treatment was shown to prolong PFS. However, median OS after metastasis did not differ with regard to local treatment (72.3 vs. 91.0 months, p = 0.272).We showed that local treatment could positively affect disease progression in HR-positive and HER2-negative oligometastatic breast cancer.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

This article aims to compare the severity of disease and the surgical treatment of diagnosed breast cancer patients with and without prior physical disability.A total of 4,194 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent surgery in a breast cancer center in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, participated in an annual postoperative postal survey, which was complemented by clinical data. Latent class analysis and logit path models were applied to study (1) differences in terms of UICC staging and local cancer treatment between patients with and without prior physical disability and (2) respective differences by disability severity.Patients with physical disability (n = 780; 18.7%) had a higher chance of receiving mastectomy compared to breast-conserving therapy, even after controlling for socioeconomic status and UICC staging. Disability severity is directly and indirectly associated with receiving a mastectomy.In light of the research gap on disability and cancer, this work indicates disparities in care for breast cancer patients with prior physical disability. Inequalities might be attributable to (1) unequal access to care, (2) individual preferences and difficulties, or (3) medical difficulties.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

Primary outcome variables included breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS). Among the patients, 1,724 (19.3%) who underwent surgical treatment (ST) of primary breast tumor had increased OS (p < 0.001) and BCSS (p < 0.001) compared with those in the nonsurgical treatment (NST) group. Multivariate analysis revealed that surgery improved survival and was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.617; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.562-0.676, p < 0.001) and BCSS (HR = 0.623; 95% CI, 0.565-0.686, p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "The question of overtreatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was raised because a significant proportion of especially low-grade DCIS lesions never progress to invasive cancer. The rationale for the present study was to analyze the value of stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) for complete removal of DCIS, focusing on the relationship between the absence of residual microcalcifications after stereotactic VAB and the histopathological diagnosis of the definitive surgical specimen.Data of 58 consecutive patients diagnosed with DCIS by stereotactic VAB in a single breast center between 2012 and 2017 were analyzed. Patient records from the hospital information system were retrieved, and mammogram reports and images as well as histopathology reports were evaluated. The extent of microcalcifications before and after biopsy as well as the occurrence of DCIS in biopsy and definitive surgical specimens were analyzed and correlated.There was no correlation between the absence of residual microcalcifications in the post-biopsy mammogram and the absence of residual DCIS in the final surgical specimen (p = 0.085). Upstaging to invasive cancer was recorded in 4 cases (13%) but occurred only in the group that had high-grade DCIS on biopsy. Low-grade DCIS was never upgraded to high-grade DCIS in the definitive specimen.The radiological absence of microcalcifications after stereotactic biopsy does not rule out residual DCIS in the final surgical specimen. Since upstaging to invasive cancer is seen in a substantial proportion of high-grade DCIS, the surgical excision of high-grade DCIS should remain the treatment of choice.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

Data indicated that CAM use correlates with younger age, higher education levels, higher income, and less physician consultations. However, non-CAM use and predictors for non-CAM use are less clear among breast and gynecological cancer patients.The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of non-CAM use and to investigate factors that might influence non-CAM use.The survey was conducted in breast cancer patients from January to May 2013 and in gynecological cancer patients from January to May 2014 with 2 pseudoanonymous questionnaires: one for CAM users (109 questions) and one for non-CAM users (85 questions). The survey was conducted via a telephone interview with 333 patients. Eligible participants were women with breast cancer (n = 285) and gynecological cancer (n = 291) who had undergone surgery at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the Technical University Munich, Germany, in the years 2012 (breast cancer) and 2011-2013 (gynecological cancer). Descriptive statistics were generated to determine patterns of non-CAM use. Univariable analysis was used to detect patient characteristics associated with noninterest in the different CAM therapies.A total of 333 of 576 patients participated in the survey (58%). Fifty-eight percent (n = 192/333) were diagnosed with breast cancer and 42% (n = 141/333) with gynecological cancer. The overall prevalence of non-CAM use was 42% (n = 139/333). Eighty-one percent (n = 112/139) of the non-CAM users stated to have received no recommendation for CAM use, although 53% (n = 73/139) would have liked to receive information from their physician. As reasons for the nonuse of CAM therapies, 76% (n = 106/139) nonusers declared that they did not believe CAM use was necessary since the conventional therapy was considered sufficient, 44% (n = 61/139) reported a lack of information, 31% (n = 43/139) a fear of fraud, and 22% (n = 31/139) a fear of interactions and side effects of CAM. Sixty-eight percent (n = 95/139) of the patients stated that they would resort to CAM if the disease progressed while only 27% (n = 37/139) would still not use any CAM with progression of disease. Five percent (7/139) did not give any information regarding possible future CAM use with disease progression. Seventy-three percent (n = 102/139) would both welcome more physicians with qualifications in complementary medicine and supported an integration of CAM into our health care system. Furthermore, statistically significant correlations between patients' sociodemographic characteristics and their nonuse of complementary therapies were identified.Our data demonstrate a high overall interest in CAM even in non-CAM users. Health care professionals should be aware of this in order to be able to better address patients' needs. It is necessary to explore the use of CAM with cancer patients, educate them about potentially beneficial therapies even in the light of the limited available evidence, and work towards an integrated model of health care. Therefore, we implemented a counseling service as an outpatient program (ZIGG) for integrative medicine concepts and evidence-based complementary treatments to discuss integrative health approaches proactively with cancer patients in our cancer center in 2013.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

        "abstract": "The relationship between imaging features and nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis is not clear.To determine whether imaging features could predict NSLN metastasis in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive breast cancer patients and to provide new clues for avoiding unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection.171 patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes and a pathologically positive SLN were recruited between January 2007 and January 2014. According to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), the effects of clinicopathological factors, especially imaging features, on NSLN metastases were assessed by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.The average number of dissected SLNs was 2.11 (range, 1-6); 56 of the 171 (32.75%) patients exhibited NSLN metastases. In univariate analysis, tumor size, number of positive SLNs, ratio of positive SLNs, mammographic mass margins, ultrasonographic mass margins, and ultrasonographic vascularity were significantly correlated with NSLN involvement. Furthermore, through multivariate analysis, tumor size, number of positive SLNs, mammographic mass margins, and ultrasonographic vascularity were still independent predictors of NSLN involvement. Additionally, in SLN-positive patients, number of positive SLNs and ultrasonographic vascularity could also predict the tumor burden in NSLN.In addition to tumor size and the number of positive SLNs, mammographic mass margins and ultrasonographic vascularity were also independent predictors of NSLN metastases in SLN-positive patients of breast cancer. The number of positive SLNs and ultrasonographic vascularity could also predict the tumor burden in NSLN.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify if breast reconstruction is a surgical risk factor for axillary web syndrome (AWS) in breast cancer (BC) patients.The data of 207 patients who have been diagnosed with unilateral BC and who had mastectomy and lymph node dissection were retrospectively reviewed. Information of their clinical and pathological data, whether they had immediate -reconstruction and intraoperative radiotherapy, surgical methods, and postoperative complications during the 3 months after their surgery (AWS, lymphedema, seroma, and myofascial adhesion) were collected, and the incidence of AWS was compared between different surgical methods.The overall incidence of AWS was 48.8% in 207 patients. Of the 22 patients who received reconstruction, 19 developed AWS, yielding an incidence of 86%. Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed that patients who underwent reconstruction had a significantly higher incidence of AWS (odds ratio, 4.74), as did patients with postoperative complication of myofascial adhesion (odds ratio, 7.07).BC survivors after breast reconstruction are susceptible to AWS, and there is a significant association between myofascial adhesion and AWS. Our results can stimulate further investigation and provide an evidence base for the development of educational guidance for patients who plan to undergo breast reconstruction.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

The objective of this study was to identify the functions of circRNAs in breast cancer (BCa).BCa and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were collected from 99 patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the relationship between circPVT1 and prognosis. CircPVT1 expression levels in BCa tissues and cell lines were detected via PCR. Transfection technology was used to silence circPVT1 and overexpress miR-204-5p. Cell biological behavior was analyzed, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins were detected by Western blot. In vivo experiments were performed with the subcutaneous xenograft tumor model.CircPVT1 was markedly overexpressed in BCa tissues and cell lines. Higher expression of circPVT1 was correlated with poor prognosis of BCa patients. Knockdown circPVT1 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of BCa cells invitro, and suppressed BCa tumor growth invivo. CircPVT1 knockdown upregulated E-cadherin and downregulated N-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug and Twist in BCa cells. Moreover, circPVT1 could serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-204-5p, and restoration of miR-204-5p abrogated the oncogenic role of circPVT1 in BCa cells.CircPVT1 as a potentially valuable biomarker for BCa diagnosis and therapeutic target for BCa treatment.

Most existing approaches require certain replicates of the error-contaminated covariates, which may not be available in the data. We propose generalized methods of moments (GMM) non-parametric correction approaches that use instrumental variables observed in a calibration subsample. The instrumental variable is related to the underlying true covariates through a general nonparametric model, and the probability of being in the calibration subsample may depend on the observed variables. We first take a simple approach adopting the inverse selection probability weighting technique using the calibration subsample. We then improve the approach based on the GMM using the whole sample. The asymptotic properties are derived and the finite sample performance is evaluated through simulation studies and an application to a real data set.",

        "abstract": "Radiomics involves the study of tumor images to identify quantitative markers explaining cancer heterogeneity. The predominant approach is to extract hundreds to thousands of image features, including histogram features comprised of summaries of the marginal distribution of pixel intensities, which leads to multiple testing problems and can miss out on insights not contained in the selected features. In this paper, we present methods to model the entire marginal distribution of pixel intensities via the quantile function as functional data, regressed on a set of demographic, clinical, and genetic predictors to investigate their effects of imaging-based cancer heterogeneity. We call this approach quantile functional regression, regressing subject-specific marginal distributions across repeated measurements on a set of covariates, allowing us to assess which covariates are associated with the distribution in a global sense, as well as to identify distributional features characterizing these differences, including mean, variance, skewness, heavy-tailedness, and various upper and lower quantiles. To account for smoothness in the quantile functions, account for intrafunctional correlation, and gain statistical power, we introduce custom basis functions we call quantlets that are sparse, regularized, near-lossless, and empirically defined, adapting to the features of a given data set and containing a Gaussian subspace so non-Gaussianness can be assessed. We fit this model using a Bayesian framework that uses nonlinear shrinkage of quantlet coefficients to regularize the functional regression coefficients and provides fully Bayesian inference after fitting a Markov chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the benefit of the basis space modeling through simulation studies, and apply the method to Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based radiomic dataset from Glioblastoma Multiforme to relate imaging-based quantile functions to various demographic, clinical, and genetic predictors, finding specific differences in tumor pixel intensity distribution between males and females and between tumors with and without DDIT3 mutations.",

        "abstract": "Pathway analysis allows joint consideration of multiple SNPs belonging to multiple genes, which in turn belong to a biologically defined pathway. This type of analysis is usually more powerful than single-SNP analyses for detecting joint effects of variants in a pathway.We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model by fully modeling the 3-level hierarchy, namely, SNP-gene-pathway that is naturally inherent in the structure of the pathways, unlike the currently used ad hoc ways of combining such information. We model the effects at each level conditional on the effects of the levels preceding them within the generalized linear model framework. To deal with the high dimensionality, we regularize the regression coefficients through an appropriate choice of priors. The model is fit using a combination of iteratively weighted least squares and expectation-maximization algorithms to estimate the posterior modes and their standard errors. A normal approximation is used for inference.We conduct simulations to study the proposed method and find that our method has higher power than some standard approaches in several settings for identifying pathways with multiple modest-sized variants. We illustrate the method by analyzing data from two genome-wide association studies on breast and renal cancers.Our method can be helpful in detecting pathway association.&#169; 2020 S.

The dismal therapeutic effect is attributed to the chemotherapy resistance and unique pathophysiology with abundant inflammatory cytokines and abnormal hyperplasia of extracellular matrix (ECM). Based on the theory that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can influence the tumorous microenvironment and malignant growth of PDAC, we employed exosomes (Exos) derived from BM-MSCs as PDAC-homing vehicles to surpass the restrictions of pathological ECM and increase the accumulation of therapeutics in tumor site. To overcome chemoresistance of PDAC, paclitaxel (PTX) and gemcitabine monophosphate (GEMP)-an intermediate product of gemcitabine metabolism-were loaded in/on the purified Exos. In this work, the Exo delivery platform showed superiorities in homing and penetrating abilities, which were performed on tumor spheroids and PDAC orthotopic models. Meanwhile, the favorable anti-tumor efficacy in vivo and in vitro, plus relatively mild systemic toxicity, was found. Loading GEMP and PTX, benefitting from the naturally PDAC selectivity, the Exo platform we constructed performs combined functions on excellent penetrating, anti-matrix and overcoming chemoresistance (Scheme 1). Worth expectantly, the Exo platform may provide a prospective approach for targeted therapies of PDAC.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The aim of this study was to explore the 8-year (2004-2011) trends in health-care costs for Taiwanese cancer decedents in their last month of life and, specifically, to assess the association of these trends with hospice care.We conducted a population-based longitudinal study and analyzed data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The data consisted of not only claims information - costs of hospitalization and outpatient department visits - but also the associated patient characteristics, catastrophic illness status, hospice patient designation, and insurance system exit date (the proxy for death).A total of 11,104 cancer decedents were enrolled, and 2144 (19.3%) of these patients received hospice care. The rate of hospice service use increased from 14.9% to 21.5% over 8 years. From 2004 to 2011, the mean health-care cost per day in the last month of life increased 8.2% (from US$93 &#177; $108 in 2004 to US$101 &#177; $110 in 2011; P = 0001). We compared three groups of patients who received hospice care for more than 1 month (long-H group), received hospice care for 30 days or less (short-H group), and did not receive hospice care (non-H group). Compared to non-H group, long-H group had a significantly lower mean health-care cost per day during their last month of life (US$85.7 &#177; 57.3 vs. US$102.4 &#177; 120) (P < 0001).

This partially stems from the presence of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), a highly plastic cellular subpopulation that is resistant to current therapies. In addition to resistance, the blood-brain barrier limits the penetration of most drugs into GBMs. To effectively deliver a BTIC-specific inhibitor to brain tumors, we developed a multicomponent nanoparticle, termed Fe@MSN, which contains a mesoporous silica shell and an iron oxide core. Fibronectin-targeting ligands directed the nanoparticle to the near-perivascular areas of GBM. After Fe@MSN particles deposited in the tumor, an external low-power radiofrequency (RF) field triggered rapid drug release due to mechanical tumbling of the particle resulting in penetration of high amounts of drug across the blood-brain tumor interface and widespread drug delivery into the GBM. We loaded the nanoparticle with the drug 1400W, which is a potent inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). It has been shown that iNOS is preferentially expressed in BTICs and is required for their maintenance. Using the 1400W-loaded Fe@MSN and RF-triggered release, in vivo studies indicated that the treatment disrupted the BTIC population in hypoxic niches, suppressed tumor growth and significantly increased survival in BTIC-derived GBM xenografts.",

However, its use is limited by its multi-organ toxicity, including nephrotoxicity, which is related to MTX-driven oxidative stress. Silencing oxidative stressors is therefore an important strategy in minimizing MTX adverse effects.Medicinal plants rich in phenolic compounds are probable candidates to overcome these oxidants. Herein, C. pentandra ethyl acetate extract showed powerful in&#160;vitro radical-scavenging potential (IC50&#8239;=&#8239;0.0716) comparable to those of the standard natural (ascorbic acid, IC50&#8239;=&#8239;0.045) and synthetic (BHA, IC50&#8239;=&#8239;0.056) antioxidants. The effect of C. pentandra ethyl acetate extract against MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in rats was evaluated by administering the extract (400&#8239;mg/kg/day) or the standard antioxidant silymarin (100&#8239;mg/kg/day) orally for 5 days before and 5 days after a single MTX injection (20&#8239;mg/kg, i.p.).C.&#160;pentandra showed slight superiorities over silymarin in restoring the MTX-impaired renal functions, with approximately twofold decreases in overall kidney function tests. C.&#160;pentandra also improved renal antioxidant capacity and reduced the MTX-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, C.&#160;pentandra inhibited MTX-initiated apoptotic and inflammatory cascades, and attenuated MTX-induced histopathological changes in renal tissue architecture.Phytochemical investigation of the extract led to the purification of the phenolics quercitrin (1), cinchonains 1a (2) and 1b (3), cis-clovamide (4), trans-clovamide (5), and glochidioboside (6); a structurally similar with many of the reported antioxidant and nephroprotective agents.

Conjugates of the current gold-standard chelator for 44Sc, 1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), require heating to achieve radiochemical complexation, limiting application of this isotope in conjunction with temperature-sensitive biologics.

Sc(picaga)-DUPA exhibits a K i of 1.6 nM for PSMA, comparable to the 18F-based imaging probe DCFPyL (K i = 1.1 nM) currently in phase 3 clinical trials for imaging prostate cancer. Finally, we successfully employed 44Sc(picaga)-DUPA to image PSMA-expressing tumors in a preclinical mouse model, establishing the picaga bifunctional chelator as an optimal choice for the 44Sc PET nuclide.This journal is &#169; The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",

Here, we provide evidence for different evolutionary processes leading to the diversification of modular NRPSs and thus, their respective products. Discovery of a novel lipo-octapeptide family from Pseudomonas, the virginiafactins, and detailed structure elucidation of closely related peptides, the cichofactins and syringafactins, allowed retracing recombinational diversification of the respective NRPS genes. Bioinformatics analyses allowed us to spot an evolutionary snapshot of these processes, where recombination occurred both within the same and between different biosynthetic gene clusters. Our systems feature a recent diversification process, which may represent a typical paradigm to variations in modular biosynthetic machineries.This journal is &#169; The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",

Let-7 miRNA is known to be downregulated in a variety of cancers, especially BCSCs, whereas CDK4 being overexpressed in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) overexpressing tumor cells. In this study, let-7 miRNA and CDK4-specific siRNA were chosen as therapeutic agents and co-encapsulated in Herceptin-conjugated cationic liposomes for breast cancer therapy. Particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficacy of mi/siRNA-loaded PEGylated liposome conjugated with Herceptin (Her-PEG-Lipo-mi/siRNA) were 176&#160;nm, 28.1&#160;mV, and 99.7% &#177; 0.1%, respectively. Enhanced cellular uptake (86%) was observed by fluorescence microscopy when SK-BR-3 cells were treated with Her-PEG-Lipo-mi/siRNA. Also, the increased amount of let-7a mRNA and decreased amount of cellular CDK4 mRNA were observed by qRT-PCR when SK-BR-3 cells were treated with Her-PEG-Lipo-mi/siRNA, which was even more so when SK-BR-3 stem cells were used (197&#160;vs 768 times increase for let-7a, 62% vs 68% decrease for CDK4). Growth inhibition (65%) and migration arrest (0.5%) of the cells were achieved by the treatment of the cells with Her-PEG-Lipo-mi/siRNA, but not with mi/siRNA complex or other formulations. In conclusion, an efficient liposomal delivery system for the combination of miRNA and siRNA to target the BCSCs was developed and could be used as an efficacious therapeutic modality for breast cancer.&#169; 2019 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

However, the use of natural exosomes is restricted by their low transfection efficiency. Here, we report a novel targeting tLyp-1 exosome by gene recombinant engineering for delivery of siRNA to cancer and cancer stem cells. To reach such a purpose, the engineered tLyp-1-lamp2b plasmids were constructed and amplified in Escherichia coli. The tLyp-1-lamp2b plasmids were further used to transfect HEK293T tool cells and the targeting tLyp-1 exosomes were isolated from secretion of the transfected HEK293T cells. Afterwards, the artificially synthesized siRNA was encapsulated into targeting tLyp-1 exosomes by electroporation technology. Finally, the targeting siRNA tLyp-1 exosomes were used to transfect cancer or cancer stem cells. Results showed that the engineered targeting tLyp-1 exosomes had a nanosized structure (approximately 100&#8239;nm) and high transfection efficiency into lung cancer and cancer stem cells. The function verifications demonstrated that the targeting siRNA tLyp-1 exosomes were able to knock-down the target gene of cancer cells and to reduce the stemness of cancer stem cells. In conclusion, the targeting tLyp-1 exosomes are successfully engineered, and can be used for gene therapy with a high transfection efficiency. Therefore, the engineered targeting tLyp-1 exosomes offer a promising gene delivery platform for future cancer therapy.&#169; 2019 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "PET and CT are widely used imaging modalities in radiation oncology. PET imaging has a high contrast but blurry tumor edges due to its limited spatial resolution, while CT imaging has a high resolution but a low contrast between tumor and soft normal tissues. Tumor segmentation from either a single PET or CT image is difficult. It is known that co-segmentation methods utilizing the complementary information between PET and CT can improve segmentation accuracy. These information can be either consistent or inconsistent in the image-level. How to correctly localize tumor edges with these inconsistent information is a major challenge for co-segmentation methods. In this study, we proposed a novel variational method for tumor co-segmentation in PET/CT, with a fusion strategy specifically designed to handle the information inconsistency between PET and CT in an adaptive way - the method can automatically decide which modality should be more trustful when PET and CT disagree to each other for localizing the tumor boundary. The proposed method was constructed based on the &#915;-convergence approximation of the Mumford-Shah (MS) segmentation model. A PET restoration process was integrated into the co-segmentation process, which further eliminate the uncertainty for tumor segmentation introduced by the blurring of tumor edges in PET. The performance of the proposed method was validated on a test dataset with fifty non-small cell lung cancer patients. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method had a high accuracy for PET/CT co-segmentation and PET restoration, and can accurately estimate the blur kernel of the PET scanner as well. For those complex images in which the tumors exhibit Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake inhomogeneity or even invade adjacent soft normal tissues, the proposed method can still accurately segment the tumors.

        "abstract": "In the United States, cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children. Although survival from any pediatric cancer has improved dramatically during past decades, a number of cancers continue to yield dismal prognoses, which has motivated the continued study of novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, even patients cured of pediatric cancer often experience severe adverse effects of treatment and other long-term health implications, such as cardiotoxicity or loss of fertility. For these patients, improved risk stratification to identify those who could safely receive alternate or less-intensive therapy without affecting prognosis is a key objective. Fortunately, pediatric cancers are rare overall, but even among patients with the same narrow cancer type, there is often broad heterogeneity in terms of prognosis, molecular features or pathology, current treatment strategies, and scientific objectives. As a result, the design of clinical trials in the pediatric cancer setting is challenged by a number of practical issues that must be addressed to ensure trial feasibility for this vulnerable group of patients. In this review, we discuss some of the unique trial design considerations often encountered in any rare tumor setting through the lens of our experiences as faculty statisticians for the Children's Oncology Group, the largest organization in the world dedicated exclusively to pediatric cancer research and clinical trials. These topics include risk stratification within individual trials, relaxation of trial operating characteristics and parameters, use of historical controls, and address of noninferiority-type objectives in small cohorts. We review each in terms of practical motivation, present challenges, and potential solutions described in the literature and implemented in selected example trials from the Children's Oncology Group.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "Although precision oncology is transforming clinical management of patients with cancer, many hospitals face challenges to effectively implement precision oncology. In addition, the cost and time exerted for genomic profiling needs to be balanced with expectations of benefit for each patient. This article summarizes the effort to implement precision oncology in Japan. The most promising development is that tests to profile the genomes of select cancers are now fully covered by the national health insurance system. In May 2019, two gene panels were approved with reimbursement: FoundationOne CDx Cancer Genomic Profile and OncoGuide NCC Oncopanel System, the latter of which was developed in Japan. To make better use of scarce resources, the reimbursement is restricted to patients with solid tumors that have progressed on standard chemotherapy, rare tumors, or tumors of unknown primary. To centralize Japanese precision oncology, the government designated approximately 170 hospitals and stratified them to three layers on the basis of their roles. In addition, Japan's National Cancer Center launched a Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) that collects genomic information and clinical characteristics of patients who received genomic profiling tests. C-CAT is expected to be the central data repository, to match patients with clinical trials, and to assist translational research. The centralized system under the national health insurance system could be a double-edged sword. Although tight regulation may make it hard to keep up with the rapid development of precision oncology, a federated ecosystem for sharing clinical and genomic data will be a precious asset and allow for shared access to data. Access to unapproved drugs and administrative support from C-CAT will be keys for Japanese precision oncology to meet its full potential.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

At enrollment, tumor samples underwent next-generation sequencing for any of 315 cancer-related genes to high depth (> 500&#215;) using FoundationOne CDx. Sequencing results were released to providers at the time of disease progression, and physician treatment recommendations were assessed via questionnaire. We evaluated three prespecified questions to assess patients' perceptions of genomic testing.In all, 100 patients underwent genomic testing, with a median of five mutations (range, 0 to 13 mutations) detected per patient. Genomic testing revealed one or more potential therapies in 98% of patients (98 of 100), and 60% of patients (60 of 100) had one or more recommended treatments with level I/II evidence for actionability. Among the 94 genomic text reports that were released, there was physician questionnaire data for 87 patients (response rate, 92.6%) and 31.0% of patients (27 of 87) had treatment change recommended by their physician. Of these, 37.0% (10 of 27) received the treatment supported by genomic testing. We did not detect a statistically significant difference in time-to-treatment failure (log-rank P = .87) or overall survival (P = .71) among patients who had treatment change supported by genomic testing versus those who had no treatment change. For patients who completed surveys before and after genomic testing, there was a significant decrease in confidence of treatment success, specifically among patients who did not have treatment change supported by genomic testing (McNemar's test of agreement P = .001).In this prospective study, genomic profiling of tumors in patients with MBC frequently identified potential treatments and resulted in treatment change in a minority of patients. Patients whose therapy was not changed on the basis of genomic testing seemed to have a decrease in confidence of treatment success.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are aggressive; the overall survival of patients with ACCs is 40%-50%. Appropriate staging and histologic classification are crucial because children with incomplete resections, metastases, or relapsed disease have a dismal prognosis. The clinical course of pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) is difficult to predict using the current classification schemas, which rely on subjective microscopic and gross macroscopic variables. Recent advances in adult ACT studies have revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns with prognostic significance that have not been systematically interrogated in the pediatric population.We performed DNA methylation analyses on 48 newly diagnosed ACTs from the International Pediatric Adrenocortical Tumor Registry and 12 pediatric adrenal controls to evaluate for distinct methylation groups. Pediatric methylation data were also compared systematically with the adult ACC cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Two pediatric ACT methylation groups were identified and showed differences in selected clinicopathologic and outcome characteristics. The A1 group was enriched for CTNNB1 variants and unfavorable outcome. The A2 group was enriched for TP53 germline variants, younger age at onset, and favorable outcome. Pediatric ACT methylation groups were maintained when International Pediatric Adrenocortical Tumor Registry cohort data were combined with TCGA cohort data. The CpG-island hypermethylator phenotype characterizing the TCGA cohort was not identified in the pediatric patients. When methylome findings were combined with independent histopathologic review using the Wieneke criteria, a high-risk population was identified with uniform fatal outcome.Our results indicate DNA methylation analysis can enhance current diagnostic algorithms. A combination of methylation and histologic classification produced the strongest prediction model and may prove useful in future risk-adapted therapeutic trials.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

Frequencies of pathogenic mutations were compared in patients and reference controls to identify genes enriched in metastatic prostate cancer. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify predictors of progression to mCRPC and overall survival.Sixty-eight germline mutations in 12 genes were identified in 66 men (9.4%). Mutations in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2, FANCM, and TP53 were significantly enriched (odds ratio greater than 2.0) in the metastatic cohorts compared with reference controls. The frequency of germline mutations was similar for patients with mHSPC and mCRPC (11.8% v 8.3%; P = .16). The median time to progression from mHSPC to mCRPC was 23.1 and 32.5 months for patients with and without mutations, respectively (P = .96). Although older age at diagnosis, Gleason score greater than 7, elevated alkaline phosphatase level, and high volume of disease were associated with shorter duration of progression to mCRPC and poor overall survival, mutation status was not (progression to mCRPC hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.09; P = .17; overall survival hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.34; P = .98).Similarly elevated rates of germline predisposition gene mutations in mHSPC and mCRPC suggest that germline genetic testing may help to guide medical management for all patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. Mutation status was not associated with shorter progression to mCRPC or poor overall survival.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

There is urgent need for adoption of novel adaptive designs to improve the efficiency and success of clinical trials. A major barrier is that many conventional designs are inadequate for modern drug development, yet most novel adaptive designs are difficult to understand, require complicated statistical modeling, demand complex computation, and need expensive infrastructure for implementation. The objective of this article is to introduce and review a class of novel adaptive designs, known as model-assisted designs, to remove this barrier and increase the use of novel adaptive designs. Model-assisted designs enjoy superior performance comparable to more complicated, model-based adaptive designs, but their decision rule can be pretabulated and included in the protocol-thus implemented as simply as the conventional designs. We review state-of-the-art model-assisted designs for phase I clinical trials for single-agent, drug-combination and late-onset toxicity scenarios. We also briefly introduce model-assisted designs for phase II trials to handle binary, coprimary endpoints and delayed response. Freely available user-friendly software and trial examples (trialdesign.org) facilitate the adoption of model-assisted designs.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

We evaluated the likelihood of enrollment in a clinical trial that required the identification of a specific genomic change based on our institute-wide genomic tumor profiling.Using genomic profiling from archived tissue samples derived from patients with metastatic breast cancer treated between 2011 and 2017, we assessed the impact of systematic genomic characterization on enrollment in an ongoing phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01670877). Our primary aim was to describe the proportion of patients with a qualifying ERBB2 mutation identified by our institutional genomic panel (OncoMap or OncoPanel) who enrolled in the trial. Secondary objectives included median time from testing result to trial registration, description of the spectrum of ERBB2 mutations, and survival. Associations were calculated using Fisher's exact test.We identified a total of 1,045 patients with metastatic breast cancer without ERBB2 amplification who had available genomic testing results. Of these, 42 patients were found to have ERBB2 mutation and 19 patients (1.8%) were eligible for the trial on the basis of the presence of an activating mutation, 18 of which were identified by OncoPanel testing. Fifty-eight percent of potentially eligible patients were approached, and 33.3% of eligible patients enrolled in the trial guided exclusively by OncoPanel testing.More than one half of eligible patients were approached for trial participation and, significantly, one third of those were enrolled in NCT01670877. Our data illustrate the ability to enroll patients in trials of rare subsets in routine clinical practice and highlight the need for these broadly based approaches to effectively support the success of these studies.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

We explore some of the challenges and opportunities in optimizing data integration to accelerate breast cancer discovery and improve patient outcomes. Susan G. Komen convened three meetings (2015, 2017, and 2018) with various stakeholders to discuss challenges, opportunities, and next steps to enhance the use of big data in the field of breast cancer. Meeting participants agreed that big data approaches can enhance the identification of better therapies, improve outcomes, reduce disparities, and optimize precision medicine. One challenge is that databases must be shared, linked with each other, standardized, and interoperable. Patients want to be active participants in research and their own care, and to control how their data are used. Many patients have privacy concerns and do not understand how sharing their data can help to effectively drive discovery. Public education is essential, and breast cancer researchers who are skilled in using and analyzing big data are needed. Patient advocacy groups can play multiple roles to help maximize and leverage big data to better serve patients. Komen is committed to educating patients on big data issues, encouraging data sharing by all stakeholders, assisting in training the next generation of data science breast cancer researchers, and funding research projects that will use real-life data in real time to revolutionize the way breast cancer is understood and treated.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

We aim to evaluate the association between AR CN as a continuous variable and clinical outcome.PCR2023 was an international, multi-institution, open-label, phase II study of abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone (AAP) or abiraterone acetate plus dexamethasone that included plasma AR assessment as a predefined exploratory secondary end point. Plasma AR CN data (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01867710) from this study (n = 133) were pooled with data from the following three other cohorts: cohort A, which was treated with either AAP or enzalutamide (n = 73); the PREMIERE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02288936) of biomarkers for enzalutamide (n = 94); and a phase II trial from British Columbia (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02125357) that randomly assigned men to either AAP or enzalutamide (n = 201). The primary outcome measures for the biomarker analysis were overall survival and progression-free survival.Using multivariable fractional polynomials analysis using Cox regression models, a nonlinear relationship between plasma AR CN and outcome was identified for overall survival, where initially for small incremental gains in CN there was a large added hazard ratio that plateaued at higher CN. The CN cut point associated with the highest local hazard ratio was 1.92. A similar nonlinear association was observed with progression-free survival. In an exploratory analysis of PCR2023, the time from start of long-term androgen-deprivation therapy to start of AAP or abiraterone acetate plus dexamethasone was significantly shorter in patients with plasma AR CN of 1.92 or greater than patients with plasma AR CN of less than 1.92 (43 v 130 weeks, respectively; P = .005). This was confirmed in cohort A (P = .003), the PREMIERE cohort (P = .03), and the British Colombia cohort (P = .003).Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can be dichotomized by a plasma AR CN cut point of 1.92. Plasma AR CN value of 1.92 or greater identifies aggressive disease that is poorly responsive to AR targeting and is associated with a prior short response to primary androgen-deprivation therapy.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

We sought to comprehensively examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of BTCs with amplification or mutation of ERBB2.Demographic, outcome, and treatment response data were collected for patients with ERBB2-altered BTC identified by next-generation sequencing with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets from 2014 to 2018.A total of 517 patients with BTC underwent next-generation sequencing (ICC, n = 313; EHC, n = 93; GBC, n = 111). Twenty-eight patients (5.4%) had ERBB2 alterations, including 2.7% with ERBB2 gene amplification, 2.3% with ERBB2 mutation, and 0.4% with concurrent amplification and mutation. The prevalence of ERBB2 gene alterations was significantly higher in GBC (12.6%) than in ICC (2.2%) and EHC (7.5%; P < .001). In ERBB2-amplified tumors, the median fold change was 6.4 (range, 2.1 to 19.7), while in ERBB2-mutant tumors, the most frequent mutated domain was the extracellular domain (32%), with all mutations in this region involving the S310 codon. Frequent co-altered genes in this cohort were TP53 (54%), PIK3CA (21%), and CDKN2A (18%); KRAS amplification/mutation was found in 7% of patients. One patient with ERBB2-amplified EHC who enrolled in a basket trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02675829) had a partial response to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine.ERBB2 alterations are present in 5.4% of BTCs. When present, the degree of ERBB2 gene amplification is often high, and S310 codon mutations are the most common hotspot.

Although few question the importance of NGS in modern oncology care, the process of gathering primary molecular data, integrating it into electronic health records, and optimally using it as part of a clinical workflow remains far from seamless. Numerous challenges persist around data standards and interoperability, and clinicians frequently face difficulties in managing the growing amount of genomic knowledge required to care for patients and keep up to date.This review provides a descriptive analysis of genomic data workflows for NGS data in clinical oncology and issues that arise from the inconsistent use of standards for sharing data across systems. Potential solutions are described.NGS technology, especially for somatic genomics, is well established and widely used in routine patient care, quality measurement, and research. Available genomic knowledge bases play an evolving role in patient management but lack harmonization with one another. Questions about their provenance and timeliness of updating remain. Potentially useful standards for sharing genomic data, such as HL7 FHIR and mCODE, remain primarily in the research and/or development stage. Nonetheless, their impact will likely be seen as uptake increases across care settings and laboratories. The specific use case of ASCO CancerLinQ, as a clinicogenomic database, is discussed.Because the electronic health records of today seem ill suited for managing genomic data, other solutions are required, including universal data standards and applications that use application programming interfaces, along with a commitment on the part of sequencing laboratories to consistently provide structured genomic data for clinical use.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in biotechnology and cancer genomics have afforded enormous opportunities for development of more effective anticancer therapies. A key thrust of this modern drug development paradigm is successful identification of predictive biomarkers that can distinguish patients who might be sensitive to new targeted therapies. To respond to this challenge, a number of phase III cancer trial designs integrating biomarker-based objectives have been proposed and implemented in oncology drug development. In this article, we provide an updated review of commonly used biomarker-based randomized clinical trial designs, with a particular focus on design efficiency. When the efficacy of a new therapy may be limited to a biomarker-defined subgroup, the choice of an appropriate randomized clinical trial design should be guided by the strength of the biomarker's credentials. If compelling evidence indicates that a targeted therapy is beneficial only in a particular biomarker-defined subgroup, an enrichment design should be used. If there is strong evidence that the treatment is likely to be more beneficial in the biomarker-positive patients but a meaningful benefit is also possible in the biomarker-negative patients, then a properly powered biomarker-stratified design (eg, a subgroup-specific or Marker Sequential Test strategy) would provide the most rigorous determination of the sensitive populations. If the evidence supporting the predictive value of the biomarker is weak and the treatment is expected to work in the overall population, then a fallback design could be used. Careful selection of an appropriate phase III design strategy that integrates evaluation of a new anticancer therapy and its companion diagnostic is critical to the success of precision medicine in oncology.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

This has been initially explained by the requirement of extracellular ANXA1 (which is released from dying cancer cells) to engage formyl peptide receptor-1 (FPR1) on dendritic cells (DC) for the establishment of corpse/DC synapses. Here, we show that ANXA1-deficent cancer cells exhibit a defect in the exposure of calreticulin (CALR), which is an important \"eat-me\" signal, facilitating the phagocytic uptake of dead-cell antigens by DC. Of note, intratumoral injection of recombinant CALR protein was able to restore the therapeutic response of ANXA1-deficient cancers to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Carcinomas developing in patients tend to downregulate ANXA1 expression as compared to their normal tissues of origin. ANXA1-low breast, colorectal, lung and kidney cancers are scarcely infiltrated by DC and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, supporting the idea that ANXA1 deficiency facilitates immune escape. We propose that such ANXA1-low cancers might be particularly suitable to local immunotherapy with CALR protein.&#169; 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Through combination of whole-exome sequencing analysis with mass spectrometry of MHC class I eluted peptides we could identify eight candidate epitopes. Of these, a neo-epitope encoded by a point-mutation in the sequence of the ribosomal protein L18 (Rpl18) strongly dominated the CD8+ T cell response to our MC-38 cell-line in comparison to a previously described neo-epitope in the Adpgk protein. Therapeutic vaccination with synthetic peptides induced CD8+ T cell responses against the mutated Rpl18 epitope, which controlled tumor growth in vivo. This immunologically dominant response to mutated Rpl18 is of great importance in the development and optimization of immunotherapeutic strategies with the MC-38 tumor model.&#169; 2020 The Author(s).

The major factor in MDR is efflux pump-mediated resistance. A unique pump can make bacteria withstand a wide range of structurally diverse compounds. Therefore, their inhibition is a promising route to eliminate resistance phenomenon in bacteria. Phytochemicals are excellent alternatives as resistance-modifying agents. They can directly kill bacteria or interact with the crucial events of pathogenicity, thereby decreasing the ability of bacteria to develop resistance. Numerous botanicals display noteworthy efflux pumps inhibitory activities. Edible plants are of growing interest. Likewise, some plant families would be excellent sources of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) including Apocynaceae, Berberidaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, and Zingiberaceae. Easily applicable methods for screening plant-derived EPIs include checkerboard synergy test, berberine uptake assay and ethidium bromide test. In silico high-throughput virtual detection can be evaluated as a criterion of excluding compounds with efflux substrate-like characteristics, thereby improving the selection process and extending the identification of EPIs. To ascertain the efflux activity inhibition, real-time PCR and quantitative mass spectrometry can be applied. This review emphasizes on efflux pumps and their roles in transmitting bacterial resistance and an update plant-derived EPIs and strategies for identification.&#169; 2019 Xi'an Jiaotong University.

        "title": "Cadmium telluride quantum dot-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells: a further study of the cellular response by proteomics.",
        "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) are luminescent nanoparticles with superior versatility. In this regard, cadmium telluride (CdTe) QDs have been widely used for various bioimaging applications. Although these nano-Cd containing particles can be capped with shells to reduce their cytotoxicity, these shells would be gradually disintegrated after a certain period of time, thereby inevitably exerting nanotoxicity. Previously, we showed that treatment of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with uncapped CdTe QDs (520Q, 580Q and 730Q with emission maximum at 520, 580 and 730 nm, respectively) elicited dose-dependent cytotoxicity for 520Q and 580Q (<5 nm), while 730Q (>5 nm) elicited negligible cytotoxicity. In order to gain a more global perspective on the action mechanism of these nano-Cd particles, here, we further characterized the proteome response of BEAS-2B when challenged with the above QDs. Interestingly, among the three nano-Cd particles, we observed that 520Q and 580Q treatment altered the BEAS-2B proteome significantly in a very similar magnitude while 730Q has no obvious impact at all, as compared with the untreated control. Notably, the treatment of BEAS-2B with glutathione before nano-Cd particles abrogated the induction/repression of differentially expressed proteins and prevented cell death. Taken together, our findings show that uncapped CdTe nanoparticles (520Q and 580Q) induce oxidative stress in human bronchial epithelial cells, and the similarly altered protein signatures also suggest potential mitotoxicity and common cellular and detoxification responses upon exposure of lung cells to these two QDs. On the other hand, 730Q may exert a more noticeable effect after long-term exposure, but not upon transient exposure.This journal is &#169; The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",

        "abstract": "Optimal biomarker combinations for treatment-selection can be derived by minimizing total burden to the population caused by the targeted disease and its treatment. However, when multiple biomarkers are present, including all in the model can be expensive and hurt model performance. To remedy this, we consider feature selection in optimization by minimizing an extended total burden that additionally incorporates biomarker costs. Formulating it as a 0-norm penalized weighted-classification, we develop various procedures for estimating linear and nonlinear combinations. Through simulations and a real data example, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating feature-selection and marker cost when deriving treatment-selection rules.",

        "abstract": "Effective preoperative regimens and biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are lacking. We prospectively evaluated fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)-based treatment and imaging-based biomarkers for borderline resectable PDAC.Eligible patients had treatment-na&#239;ve, histology-confirmed PDAC and one or more high-risk features: mesenteric vessel involvement, CA 19-9 level of 500 mg/dL or greater, and indeterminate metastatic lesions. Patients received modified FOLFIRINOX and chemoradiation before anticipated pancreatectomy. Tumors were classified on baseline computed tomography as high delta (well-defined interface with parenchyma) or low delta (ill-defined interface). We designated computed tomography interface response after therapy as type I (remained or became well defined) or type II (became ill defined). The study had 80% power to differentiate a 60% from 40% resection rate (&#945; = .10). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and subgroups were compared using log-rank tests.Thirty-three patients initiated therapy; 45% underwent pancreatectomy. The median OS was 24 months (95% CI, 16.2 to 29.6 months). For patients who did and did not undergo pancreatectomy, the median OS was 42 months (95% CI, 17.7 months to not estimable) and 14 months (95% CI, 9.0 to 24.8 months), respectively. Patients with high-delta tumors had lower 3-year PFS (4% v 40%) and 3-year OS rates (20% v 60%) than those with low-delta tumors (both P < .05). Patients with type II interface responses had lower 3-year PFS (0% v 29%) and 3-year OS rates (16% v 47%) than those with type I responses (both P < .001).Preoperative FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiation for high-risk borderline resectable PDAC was associated with a resection rate of 45% and median OS of approximately 2 years. Our imaging-based biomarker validation indicates that personalized treatment may be achieved using these biomarkers at baseline and post-treatment.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "Atypical, non-V600 BRAF (aBRAF) mutations represent a rare molecular subtype of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Preclinical data are used to categorize aBRAF mutations into class II (intermediate to high levels of kinase activity, RAS independent) and III (low kinase activity level, RAS dependent). The clinical impact of these mutations on anti-EGFR treatment efficacy is unknown.Data from 2,084 patients with mCRC at a single institution and from an external cohort of 5,257 circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples were retrospectively analyzed. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Statistical tests were two-sided.BRAF mutations were harbored by 257 patients, including 36 with aBRAF mutations: 22 class III, 10 class II, four unclassified. For patients with aBRAF mCRC, median OS was 36.1 months, without a difference between classes, and median OS was 21.0 months for patients with BRAFV600E mCRC. In contrast to right-sided predominance of tumors with BRAFV600E mutation, 53% of patients with aBRAF mCRC had left-sided primary tumors. Concurrent RAS mutations were noted in 33% of patients with aBRAF mCRC, and 67% of patients had microsatellite stable disease. Among patients with aBRAF RAS wild-type mCRC who received anti-EGFR antibodies (monotherapy, n = 1; combination therapy, n = 10), no responses to anti-EGFR therapy were reported, and six patients (four with class III aBRAF mutations, one with class II, and one unclassified) achieved stable disease as best response. Median time receiving therapy was 4 months (range, 1 to 16). In the ctDNA cohort, there was an increased prevalence of aBRAF mutations and subclonal aBRAF mutations (P < .001 for both) among predicted anti-EGFR exposed compared with nonexposed patients.Efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy is limited in class II and III aBRAF mCRC. Detection of aBRAF mutations in ctDNA after EGFR inhibition may represent a novel mechanism of resistance.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

Disease burden (total tumor volume, number of disease sites), radiomic measures of intertumor heterogeneity (cluster-site entropy, cluster-site dissimilarity), and intratumor heterogeneity of the largest lesion (Haralick texture features) were computed. Associations of clinical, conventional imaging, and radiomic measures with durable clinical benefit and time to off-treatment were examined.In univariable analysis, fewer disease sites, lower intertumor heterogeneity (lower cluster-site entropy, lower cluster-site dissimilarity), and lower intratumor heterogeneity of the largest lesion (higher energy) were significantly associated with durable clinical benefit (P &#8804; .031). More disease sites, presence of pleural disease and/or distant metastases, higher intertumor heterogeneity (higher cluster-site entropy, higher cluster-site dissimilarity), and higher intratumor heterogeneity of the largest lesion (higher Contrastlargest-lesion) were significantly associated with shorter time to off-treatment (P &#8804; .034). In multivariable analysis, higher Energylargest-lesion (indicator of lower intratumor heterogeneity; P = .006; odds ratio, 1.41) and fewer disease sites (P = .003; odds ratio, 1.64) remained significant indicators of durable clinical benefit (multivariable model C-index, 0.821). Higher cluster-site dissimilarity (indicator of higher intertumor heterogeneity) was a modest but single independent indicator of shorter time to off-treatment (P = .004; hazard ratio, 1.19; C-index, 0.6).Fewer disease sites and lower intra- and intertumor heterogeneity modeled from the baseline CE-CT may indicate better response of OC to immunotherapy.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

Here, we modeled expected absolute chemotherapy benefit on the basis of EPclin test results.The effect of chemotherapy was modeled using previously validated 10-year risk of distant recurrence as a function of EPclin score for patients treated without chemotherapy. Average relative chemotherapy benefit to reduce breast cancer distant recurrence was evaluated using a published meta-analysis from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group. Absolute chemotherapy benefit differences were estimated across a range of interaction strengths between relative chemotherapy benefit and EPclin score. The average absolute benefit was calculated for patients with high and low EPclin scores using the distribution of scores in 2,185 samples tested by Myriad Genetics.The average expected absolute benefit of chemotherapy treatment for patients with a low EPclin score was 1.8% in the absence of interaction and 1.5% for maximal interaction. Conversely, the expected average absolute chemotherapy benefit for patients with a high EPclin score was 5.3% and 7.3% for no interaction and maximal interaction, respectively.For women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative early-stage breast cancer, a high EPclin score identified which patients would benefit most from adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of absolute reduction of distant recurrence, regardless of the amount of interaction between EPclin and relative chemotherapy benefit. A high degree of prognostic discrimination for distant recurrence is more important for identifying patients likely to benefit most from chemotherapy than an interaction between EPclin and treatment-relative benefit.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is not considered a component of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome but can arise in patients with germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutations. Biallelic BRCA1/2 alterations are associated with genomic features of homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency (HRD) in cancer. We sought to determine if ECs in gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers harbor biallelic alterations and/or features of HRD.Of 769 patients with EC who underwent germline panel testing, 10 pathogenic gBRCA1/2 mutation carriers were identified, and their tumor- and normal-derived DNA was subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting at least 410 cancer-related genes. Three gBRCA1/2-associated ECs were identified in 232 ECs subjected to whole-exome sequencing by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Somatic mutations, copy number alterations, loss of heterozygosity, microsatellite instability (MSI), and genomic HRD features were assessed.Of the 13 patients included who had EC, eight harbored pathogenic gBRCA1 mutations and five harbored gBRCA2 mutations. Eight (100%) and two (40%) ECs harbored biallelic BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations through loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele. All ECs harbored somatic TP53 mutations. One monoallelic/sporadic gBRCA2-associated EC had MLH1 promoter methylation and was MSI high. High large-scale state transition scores, a genomic feature of HRD, were found only in ECs with bi- but not monoallelic BRCA1/2 alterations. The Signature Multivariate Analysis HRD signature Sig3 was enriched in biallelic gBRCA1/2 ECs, and the three ECs from The Cancer Genome Atlas with BRCA1 biallelic alterations subjected to whole-exome sequencing displayed a dominant HRD-related mutational signature 3.A subset of gBRCA1/2-associated ECs harbor biallelic BRCA1/2 alterations and genomic features of HRD, which may benefit from homologous recombination-directed treatment regimens. ECs in BRCA2 mutation carriers might be sporadic and even MSI high, and may potentially benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibition.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

The VHA established the National Precision Oncology Program in 2016 to implement and standardize the practice of precision oncology across the diverse VHA system.Tumor or peripheral blood specimens from veterans with advanced solid tumors who were eligible for treatment were submitted for next-generation sequencing (NGS) at two commercial laboratories. Annotated results were generated by the laboratories and independently using IBM Watson for Genomics. Levels-of-evidence treatment recommendations were based on OncoKB criteria.From July 2016 to June 2018, 3,698 samples from 72 VHA facilities were submitted for NGS testing, of which 3,182 samples (86%) were successfully sequenced. Most samples came from men with lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Thirty-four percent of samples were from patients who lived in a rural area. TP53, ATM, and KRAS were among the most commonly mutated genes. Approximately 70% of samples had at least one actionable mutation, with clinical trials identified as the recommended option in more than 50%. Mutations in genes associated with a neuroendocrine prostate cancer phenotype were expressed at increased frequency among veterans than in the general population. The most frequent therapies prescribed in response to NGS testing were immune checkpoint inhibitors, EGFR kinase inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors.Clinical implementation of precision oncology is feasible across the VHA health care system, including rural sites. Veterans have unique occupational exposures that might inform the nature of the mutational signatures identified here. Importantly, these results underscore the importance of increasing clinical trial availability to veterans.&#169; 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

        "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a kind of aggressive hematological cancer, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is activated in most patients with T-ALL and responsible for poor prognosis. 20(S)-Ginsenoside Rh2 (20(S)-GRh2) is a major active compound extracted from ginseng, which exhibits anti-cancer effects. However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms of 20(S)-GRh2 targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in T-ALL have not been explored.Cell&#160;growth and cell cycle were determined to investigate the effect of 20(S)-GRh2 on ALL cells. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-related proteins were detected in 20(S)-GRh2-treated Jurkat cells by immunoblotting. Antitumor effect of 20(S)-GRh2 against T-ALL was investigated in xenograft mice. The mechanisms of 20(S)-GRh2 against T-ALL were examined by cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy.In the present study, the results showed that 20(S)-GRh2 decreased cell growth and arrested cell cycle at the G1 phase in ALL cells. 20(S)-GRh2 induced apoptosis through enhancing reactive oxygen species generation and upregulating apoptosis-related proteins. 20(S)-GRh2 significantly elevated the levels of pEGFP-LC3 and autophagy-related proteins in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was effectively blocked by 20(S)-GRh2. 20(S)-GRh2 suppressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis and autophagy by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in Jurkat cells. Finally, 20(S)-GRh2 alleviated symptoms of leukemia and reduced the number of white blood cells and CD3 staining in the spleen of xenograft mice, indicating antitumor effects against T-ALL in vivo.These findings indicate that 20(S)-GRh2 exhibits beneficial effects against T-ALL through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and could be a natural product of novel target for T-ALL therapy.&#169; 2019 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.",

Potential risk factors for HF were evaluated using Fine and Gray's regression analysis, and from this, a 21-point risk score was generated.Forty patients (8.9%) developed HF. The HF risk score included a baseline GLS >-15% (indicative of greater impairment) (6 points), baseline left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, acute myeloid leukemia (4 points each), cumulative anthracycline dose &#8805;250 mg/m2 (2 points), and age >60 years (1 point). Patients were stratified into low (score 0 to 6), moderate (score 7 to 13), and high risk (score 14 to 21). The estimated 1-year cumulative incidence of HF for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups was 1.0%, 13.6%, and 35.0%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Compared with cells in the organoid core, cells at the organoid periphery and the invasive front are found to be systematically softer, larger and more dynamic. These mechanical changes are shown to arise from supracellular fluid flow through gap junctions, suppression of which delays transition to an invasive phenotype.

Eligible patients had completed a gFOBT and tested negative in an earlier pilot study and were now due for recall. The intervention group received a mailed CRC screening recall letter from their primary care provider plus a gFOBT kit (n = 431) while the control group received a mailed CRC screening mailed recall letter alone (n = 452). The primary outcome was the uptake of gFOBT or colonoscopy within 6 months.gFOBT uptake was higher in the intervention group (61.3%, n = 264) compared with the control group (50.4%, n = 228) with an absolute difference between the two groups of 10.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 20.2%, P = <0.01). Patients in the intervention group were more likely to complete the gFOBT compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.9).Our findings show that adding gFOBT kits to the mailed recall letter increased participation among persons recalled for screening.

Sitting time has been increasingly referred to as a potentially modifiable risk factor in the prevention of chronic diseases. Identifying factors associated with sitting time, particularly those that are modifiable, will allow for more effective public health strategies. This study aimed to describe sitting time among Portuguese older adults and to evaluate associated factors. A cross-sectional study including 1423 older adults&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;65&#160;years old was conducted. Sitting time was assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Socio-demographic, health, anthropometric and functional variables were collected. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression models were conducted to study the association between these variables and sitting time. The median of sitting time was 300&#160;min/day (interquartile range&#8201;=&#8201;240&#160;min/day), which is equal to 5&#160;h/day. The following factors were directly associated with longer sitting time: being male, age&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;80&#160;years, living in Central or Southern Portugal, being retired from work, as well as presenting low physical activity, obesity or longer time to walk 4.6 metres. On the other hand, being married, having higher education and higher household income were inversely associated with longer sitting time. It can be concluded that Portuguese older adults spend a considerable amount of time sitting per day. Potentially modifiable risk factors associated with longer sitting time in this population were related to nutritional status and functional ability.&#169; Springer Nature B.V. 2019.",

Carbon nanoparticle (CN) is a novel lymph node tracer and has been widely used in open thyroid surgery.To evaluate the efficacy of CN in identifying LNs and preserving PGs in TOET with central neck dissection (CND).A total of 72 PTMC patients undergoing TOET with CND were retrospectively enrolled from January 2017 to January 2019. Patients were divided into a CN group (n = 38) and a control group (n = 34). The parameters including pathological characteristics, surgery related indicators, serum Ca2+ and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were compared.No significant differences were found in patient characteristics, operative complications and superior PGs preserved in situ (all p > 0.05). Total LNs and number of LNs less than 5 mm were significantly higher in the CN group than in the control group (p = 0.021, p < 0.01). The number of superior PGs preserved in situ discovered in the CN group was greater than the control group (p = 0.038). Serum PTH and Ca2+ levels dropped markedly in each group after surgery and gradually recovered in time. The CN group recovered faster than the control group.CN may be a good choice for TOET for PTMC because of better protection and faster recovery of parathyroid function, and more LNs removed.Copyright: &#169; 2020 Fundacja Videochirurgii.",

        "abstract": "Members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family have biological functions that are central to human health and disease, and MMP inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The outcomes of initial clinical trials with the first generation of MMP inhibitors proved disappointing. However, our growing understanding of the complexities of the MMP function in disease, and an increased understanding of MMP protein architecture and control of activity now provide new opportunities and avenues to develop MMP-focused therapies. Natural products that affect MMP activities have been of strong interest as templates for drug discovery, and for their use as chemical tools to help delineate the roles of MMPs that still remain to be defined. Herein, we highlight the most recent discoveries of structurally diverse natural product inhibitors to these proteases.This journal is &#169; The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in cancer therapeutics, particularly in the area of immuno-oncology, successful treatment of neuroblastoma (NB) remains a challenge. NB is the most common cancer in infants under 1&#160;year of age, and accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric cancers. Currently, children with high-risk NB exhibit a survival rate of 40-50%. The heterogeneous nature of NB makes development of effective therapeutic strategies challenging. Many preclinical models attempt to mimic the tumor phenotype and tumor microenvironment. In vivo mouse models, in the form of genetic, syngeneic, and xenograft mice, are advantageous as they replicated the complex tumor-stroma interactions and represent the gold standard for preclinical therapeutic testing. Traditional in vitro models, while high throughput, exhibit many limitations. The emergence of new tissue engineered models has the potential to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo models for therapeutic testing. Therapeutics continue to evolve from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies to biologically targeted therapies. These therapeutics act on both the tumor cells and other cells within the tumor microenvironment, making development of preclinical models that accurately reflect tumor heterogeneity more important than ever. In this review, we will discuss current in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing models, and their potential applications to therapeutic development.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

        "title": "Identification of miRNA signature associated with BMP2 and chemosensitivity of TMZ in glioblastoma stem-like cells.",
        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most lethal intracranial tumor in adults. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are responsible for tumorigenesis and chemotherapy resistance. BMPs are known to increase temozolomide (TMZ) response in GSCs, however, the intracellular molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we built a GSC cell model called U87S, and performed RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed (DE) miRNA profiles in U87S cells treated with BMP2, TMZ or combined BMP2 and TMZ respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most DE miRNAs were involved in the cancer pathways, suggesting their crucial roles in gliomagenesis. Eight miRNAs from RNA-seq were validated. Four out of these miRNAs (has-miR-199a-3p, hsa-miR-374b-5p, hsa-miR-320d, and hsa-miR-339-5p) were found significantly up-regulated in GBM tumor tissues. One of them, hsa-miR-199a-3p, was significantly correlated with the survival of GBM patients, and differentially expressed in U87S cells. Expression of hsa-miR-199a-3p was up-regulated by BMP. Overexpression of hsa-miR-199a-3p in U87S cells inhibited cell viability and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ. And activation of BMP boosted the effect of hsa-miR-199a-3p on cell viability and TMZ-mediated cytotoxicity. Besides, expressions of five predicted targets of hsa-miR-199a-3p were evaluated. Four of them were differentially expressed in GBM tumors. And one of them, SLC22A18, was associated with the survival of GBM patients. In the end, a hsa-miR-199a-3p-mediated ceRNA network was constructed for the convenience of future study. Together, our data provided DE miRNA expression profiles associated with BMP2 and TMZ in GSCs, which might lead to finding out miRNA-based target therapies that specially target GSCs.&#169; 2019 Chongqing Medical University.

        "abstract": "Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Western medicine and therapies are the primary treatment strategies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the general prognosis for HCC patients is still dismal. Under these circumstances, HCC prevention is particularly important. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) encompasses a wealth of documented therapeutic resources, and \"preventative treatment\" is the principle of TCM. In China, TCM has been used for HCC prevention for thousands of years, and has also been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of HCC in modern China. However, the TCM theory for prevention and treatment of HCC is more widely accepted in China than abroad. In this review, we first summarize the herbs and ancient formulas with therapeutic effects on HCC. We also review the research status of TCM in modern medicine as well as the current obstacles in its development. Finally, we discuss the future of TCM in the context of precision and integrated medicine. After reviewing the literature, we believe that TCM, through ancient development, is an advanced method of cancer treatment with positive curative effects, despite its surrounding controversy. Furthermore, precise analyses and systematic research methods provides novel approaches to modernize TCM for the future.&#169; 2019 Chongqing Medical University.

        "abstract": "The polypeptide chemokine Interleukin-8 (IL8) plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes in humans. IL8 is involved in chronic inflammatory lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Previous studies have shown that the interaction of IL8 with its natural receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 is critical in these diseases. Antibodies have been used to study the receptor interaction of IL8; however, the binding epitopes were hitherto unknown. Identification of the antibody epitope(s) could lead to a molecular understanding of the inhibiting mechanism and development of improved inhibitors. Here, we report the epitope identification and the affinity characterization of IL8 to a monoclonal anti-human IL8 antibody inhibiting the receptor binding by a combination of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analysis and MALDI-mass spectrometry. SPR determination of IL8 with the immobilized antibody revealed high affinity (KD, 82.2 nM). Epitope identification of IL-8 was obtained by proteolytic epitope-extraction mass spectrometry of the peptide fragments upon high pressure trypsin digestion, using an affinity microcolumn with immobilized anti-IL-8 antibody. MALDI-MS of the affinity-bound peptide elution fraction revealed an assembled (discontinuous) epitope comprising two specific peptides, IL8 [12-20] and IL8 [55-60]. Identical epitope peptides were identified by direct MALDI-MS of the eluted epitope fraction from the immobilized anti-IL8 antibody on the SPR chip. SPR determination of the synthetic epitope peptides provided high affinities confirming their binding specificity. The previously reported finding that the anti-Il8 antibody is inhibiting the IL8-CXCR1 interaction is well consistent with the overlapping region of epitope interactions identified in the present study.",

All patients who underwent elective spine surgery from 2007 to 2017 were included. Patients were stratified by the presence of DVT prophylaxis drug codes, then by comorbidities for postoperative bleeding/thrombosis. The severity of all bleeding and thrombotic complications in each cohort was studied, including the incidence of complications requiring operative washout, diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, intensive care unit admission, and mortality.A total of 119&#8201;888 patients were included. The majority of patients (118&#8201;720, >99%) were not administered postoperative DVT chemoprophylaxis while a minority of patients (1168) were. The overall rates of bleeding and thrombotic complications within the population not receiving DVT prophylaxis were 1.96% and 2.45%, respectively (P < .001). The incidence of surgical intervention for a wound washout was 0.62% compared with 1.05% for pulmonary embolism (P < .001). Intensive care unit admission rates related to a wound washout procedure or pulmonary embolism also significantly differed (0.07% vs 0.34%, P < .001). There were no observed differences in mortality. When controlling for patient comorbidity, patients with atrial fibrillation, cancer, or a prior history of thrombotic complications experienced the greatest increased risks of postoperative thrombosis.DVT prophylaxis is not routinely utilized following elective spine procedures. We report that there exist specific populations which may receive benefit from these practices, although further study is necessary to determine optimal prevention strategies for both thrombotic and bleeding complications in spine surgery.",

This pipeline explicitly accounts for off-target binding to the related serine proteases matriptase and HGFA (human hepatocyte growth factor activator). We completed the pipeline incorporating ADMET properties of the candidate inhibitors into custom multi-objective optimization functions. The ligands designed show excellent prospects for targeting hepsin via the blood stream and the urine and thus enable key experimental studies.

We aimed at developing a more accurate screening protocol by estimating the 3-year lung cancer risk after two screening CTs using deep machine learning (ML) of radiologist CT reading and other universally available clinical information.A deep machine learning (ML) algorithm was developed from 25,097 participants who had received at least two CT screenings up to two years apart in the National Lung Screening Trial. Double-blinded validation was performed using 2,294 participants from the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan). Performance of ML score to inform lung cancer incidence was compared with Lung-RADS and volume doubling time using time-dependent ROC analysis. Exploratory analysis was performed to identify individuals with aggressive cancers and higher mortality rates.In the PanCan validation cohort, ML showed excellent discrimination with a 1-, 2- and 3-year time-dependent AUC values for cancer diagnosis of 0&#183;968&#177;0&#183;013, 0&#183;946&#177;0&#183;013 and 0&#183;899&#177;0&#183;017.

To determine whether AgNP coatings modulate transcriptional responses to AgNP exposure, we exposed mice orally to 20 nm citrate (cit)-coated AgNPs (cit-AgNPs) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) at a 4 mg/kg dose for 7 consecutive days and analyzed changes in the expression of protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a new class of regulatory RNAs, in the liver. We identified unique and common expression signatures of protein-coding and lncRNA genes, altered biological processes and signaling pathways, and coding-non-coding gene interactions for cit-AgNPs and PVP-AgNPs. Commonly regulated genes comprised only about 10 and 20 percent of all differentially expressed genes in PVP-AgNP and cit-AgNP exposed mice, respectively. Commonly regulated biological processes included glutathione metabolic process and cellular oxidant detoxification. Commonly regulated pathways included Keap-Nrf2, PPAR, MAPK and IL-6 signaling pathways. The coding-non-coding gene co-expression analysis revealed that protein-coding genes were co-expressed with a variable number of lncRNAs ranging from one to twenty three and may share functional roles with the protein-coding genes. PVP-AgNP exposure induced a more robust transcriptional response than cit-AgNP exposure characterized by more than two-fold higher number of differentially expressed both protein- coding and lncRNA genes. Our data demonstrate that the surface coating strongly modulates the spectrum and the number of differentially expressed genes after oral AgNP exposure. On the other hand, our data suggest that AgNP exposure can alter drug and chemical sensitivity, metabolic homeostasis and cancer risk irrespective of the coating type, warranting further investigations.",

Studies on the prognostic value of TILs as CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, GrB+, and FOXP3+ lymphocytes for GC were retrieved, and also the related references were traced as supplements. Independent screening documents, extracting information and evaluating quality were implemented independently by 2 evaluators according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were then analyzed by meta-analysis using STATA version 12.0 software.The results indicated that high levels of intratumoral CD8+, CD3+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration were associated with better overall survival(OS) in gastric cancer patients, while high density of intratumoral FOXP3+ T cells was not closely associated with a worse outcome. Additionally, in our study, higher density of granzyme B+ (GrB+) T cell infiltration indicated an optimistic prognosis, and infiltration of a larger number of general TILs also suggested a favorable prognosis by log-rank test analysis.This meta-analysis clarified that high levels of CD8+, CD3+, and CD4+ T cell infiltration in tumor tissue showed better OS in GC patients, whereas high density of FOXP3+ T cell infiltration may not be recognized as a negative prognostic factor. These results may provide some useful prognostic indicators for clinical application in gastric cancer.Copyright: &#169; 2019 Termedia & Banach.",

Although there has been an increase in research examining moral injury among military veterans, mechanisms that link moral injury to mental health outcomes are not well understood. The present study examined rumination subcomponents (problem-focused thoughts, counterfactual thinking, repetitive thoughts, and anticipatory thoughts) as possible mediators of the associations between moral injury (both self-directed and other-directed symptoms) and negative mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, suicidality, sleep disturbance, memory problems, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms). Participants were 189 combat wounded veterans (180 men; Mean age = 43.14 years) who had experienced one or more deployments (defined as 90 days or more). Nearly all participants reported a service-connected disability (n = 176, 93.1%), with the average participant reporting a 90% total VA disability ranking, and most participants had received a purple heart (n = 163, 86.2%). Within our comprehensive mediation model, we found eight significant mediation effects with the most consistent mediator being problem-focused thoughts. Specifically, both self-directed and other- directed moral injury were associated with increased problem-focused thoughts, which in turn was associated with higher reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Taken together, rumination, and in particular, problem-focused thoughts, is relevant to understand the increased vulnerability of military veterans to exhibit poor mental health outcomes when experiencing moral injury.",

        "abstract": "Due to the lack of specific early detection methods for pancreatic cancer, it usually goes undetected until it is advanced. By employing paper-based electrodes (PPE), herein we for the first time developed a disposable low-cost paper-based immunosensor for rapid early quantitative detection of pancreatic cancer with a new biomarker, pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase one, SGK269 (PEAK1). The immunosensor was constructed by fabricating PPEs immobilized with the versatile nanomaterial graphene oxide for the incorporation of antibodies to form an immunosensing platform, without the need of complicated surface modification. After it was confirmed that the PPEs exhibited excellent electrochemical properties, a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was subsequently constructed by employing graphene oxide layers immobilized with anti-PEAK1, and the antibody conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-tagged-Anti PEAK1). Further, spectral and surface characteristic studies confirmed the formation of the immunosensing platform. The immunosensor for PEAK1 exhibited a wide linear range between 10 pg mL-1 and 106 pg mL-1 with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10 pg mL-1. The obtained results point towards rapid, sensitive, and specific early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at the point of care and other low-resource settings.",

There exists a reciprocal relation between subjective and physiological stress reactivity and recovery in smokers. Emotion regulation may impact the extent to which these domains influence each other. The current study examined the moderating role of lack of emotional awareness, lack of emotional clarity, and nonacceptance of emotions, in the relation between heart rate reactivity to, and subjective recovery from, stress, and vice versa. To determine specificity of cross-domain findings, these relations were also examined within domain. Fifty-six daily smokers (46.4% female; M age = 29.33, SD = 11.92) participated in a biological challenge. Heart rate and subjective distress were assessed continuously before, during, and after the challenge. Individual growth curve models revealed that deficits in emotional clarity significantly moderated the effect of heart rate reactivity on subjective recovery. Lack of emotional awareness also moderated the association between subjective reactivity and heart rate recovery. Emotion regulation processes did not affect relations within the same domain, but altered the relation across domains.",

        "abstract": "The finite mixture of regression (FMR) model is a popular tool for accommodating data heterogeneity. In the analysis of FMR models with high-dimensional covariates, it is necessary to conduct regularized estimation and identify important covariates rather than noises. In the literature, there has been a lack of attention paid to the differences among important covariates, which can lead to the underlying structure of covariate effects. Specifically, important covariates can be classified into two types: those that behave the same in different subpopulations and those that behave differently. It is of interest to conduct structured analysis to identify such structures, which will enable researchers to better understand covariates and their associations with outcomes. Specifically, the FMR model with high-dimensional covariates is considered. A structured penalization approach is developed for regularized estimation, selection of important variables, and, equally importantly, identification of the underlying covariate effect structure. The proposed approach can be effectively realized, and its statistical properties are rigorously established. Simulation demonstrates its superiority over alternatives. In the analysis of cancer gene expression data, interesting models/structures missed by the existing analysis are identified.",

Consequently, there is an urgent need for better understanding the molecular mechanisms, novel prognostic biomarkers, and more effective treatment options. There is an emerging link between oxytocin (OXT), the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), and cancer. However, the role of OXT or the OXTR in HCC remains unknown. The research question of this study was: Are there genetic alterations in the oxytocin (OXT) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and do these alterations impact overall survival and disease-free survival.In this retrospective study, we reviewed 360 individual HCC patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using cBioPortal accessed in April 2018. The data in The Cancer Genome Atlas are from various institutions in the United States.We found that 3% (11 of 360) of cases showed genetic alterations in the OXTR gene. The median months survival was lower for HCC cases with genetic alterations in the OXTR gene as compared to cases without genetic alteration in this gene (33.0 versus 60.84, respectively. Additionally, the median months disease-free survival was lower in cases with genetic alterations in the OXTR gene as compared to cases without alterations (8.64 versus 21.55, respectively).OXTR is a promising prognostic biomarker for HCC, and OXTR antagonists could have a future role as therapeutic agents for a subset of HCC patients. Further study of the detailed molecular mechanisms of OXT and OXTR in HCC is warranted.",

Additionally, to identify whether an association exists between perceptions of availability and attitudes concerning quality.An online, 11-item questionnaire was developed to capture clinician perspectives on the availability and use of PRO data to inform practice. The survey also asked respondents to rate information on the basis of 4 quality metrics: \"usefulness,\" \"interpretability,\" \"accessibility,\" and \"scientific rigor.\"Responses were received from 298 of 1301 invitations sent (22.9% response rate). Perceptions regarding the availability of PRO information differed widely among respondents and did not appear to be linked to practice setting. Ratings of PRO quality were generally consistent, with average ratings for the 4 quality metrics between \"satisfactory\" and \"good.\" A relationship was observed between ratings of PRO data quality and perceptions of the availability.Oncologists' attitudes toward the quality of information generated from PRO measures are favorable but not enthusiastic. These attitudes may improve as the availability of PRO data increases, given the association we observed between oncologists' ratings of the quality of PRO information and their perceptions of its availability.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

Anastomosis involving at least one non-irradiated margin reportedly significantly reduces the risk of post-operative anastomotic complications in radiation enteritis. However, the exact scope of radiotherapy on the remaining sigmoid colon remains unknown.We evaluated the radiation damage of proximally resected colorectal segments in 44 patients with rectal cancer, who received nCRT followed by conventional resection (nCRT-C, n&#8201;=&#8201;21) or proximally extended resection (nCRT-E, n&#8201;=&#8201;23). The segments from another 13 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) were used as control. We dissected these samples at a distance of 2&#8201;cm between the two adjacent sections. Radiation damage in proximally resected colorectal segments was evaluated using the radiation injury score (RIS) and the concentration and distribution patterns of angiostatin.Compared to those in the nCT group, the nCRT group showed higher RIS, levels of angiostatin, and proportion of diffuse pattern of angiostatin. With increasing distance from the tumor site, these parameters all gradually decreased; and the differences came to be not significant at the site that is over 20&#8201;cm from the tumor. The nCRT-E group showed lower RIS (median: 2 vs 4, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.002) and a greater proportion of non-diffuse angiostatin (87% vs 55%, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.039) at the proximal margins compared with the nCRT-C group.The severity of the radiation damage of the proximal colon is inversely proportional to the proximal-resection margin length. Little damage was left on the proximal margin that was over 20&#8201;cm from the tumor. Removal of an initial length of &#8805;20&#8201;cm from the tumor may be beneficial for rectal-cancer patients after nCRT.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

Clinical case: We present the case of a young woman with nonspecific symptoms, who presented with a prior history of dysuria, bladder tenesmus, suprapubic pain and urinary urgency for one year, which had been treated as recurrent urinary tract infection. A partial cystectomy plus extended lymphadenectomy was scheduled. We found a bladder tumor with characteristics of a urachal tumor and the pathological report indicated a primary bladder AC. The patient had a complete recovery at one year of follow-up. Conclusions: A patient can present with a tumor with urachal characteristics; however, the pathology report can show primary AC. The decision to perform partial cystectomy was an appropriate option for the location of this tumor, with optimal surgical results. Still, a long-term follow-up is necessary. More specific management guidelines are required for the treatment of AC.Copyright: &#169; 2019 Tejeda-Mariaca JE et al.",

Current approaches to quantify DUB activity are limited to test tube-based assays that incorporate enzymes or cell lysates, but not intact cells. The goal of this work was to develop a novel peptide-based biosensor of DUB activity that is cell permeable, protease-resilient, fluorescent, and specific to DUBs. The biosensor consists of an N-terminal &#946;-hairpin motif that acts as both a 'protectide' to increase intracellular stability and a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) to facilitate the uptake into intact cells. The &#946;-hairpin was conjugated to a C-terminal substrate consisting of the last four amino acids in ubiquitin (LRGG) to facilitate DUB mediated cleavage of a C-terminal fluorophore (AFC). The kinetics of the peptide reporter were characterized in cell lysates by dose response and inhibition enzymology studies. Inhibition studies with an established DUB inhibitor (PR-619) confirmed the specificity of both reporters to DUBs. Fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy experiments followed by mathematical modeling established the capability of the biosensor to measure DUB activity in intact cells while maintaining cellular integrity. The novel reporter introduced here is compatible with high-throughput single cell analysis platforms such as FACS and droplet microfluidics facilitating direct quantification of DUB activity in single intact cells with direct application in point-of-care cancer diagnostics and drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Tractions exerted by cells on their surroundings play an important role in many biological processes including stem cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, cell migration, cancer metastasis, and angiogenesis. The ability to quantify these tractions is important in understanding and manipulating these processes. Three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3DTFM) provides reliable means of evaluating cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads in response to these tractions in the surrounding matrix, and then using this measurement to compute the tractions. However, most applications of 3DTFM assume that the surrounding extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is non-fibrous, despite the fact that in many natural and synthetic environments the ECM contains a significant proportion of fibrous components. Motivated by this, we develop a computational approach for determining tractions, while accounting for the fibrous nature of the ECM. In particular, we make use of a fiber-based constitutive model in which the stress contains contributions from a distribution of nonlinear elastic fibers and a hyperelastic matrix. We solve an inverse problem with the nodal values of the traction vector as unknowns, and minimize the difference between a predicted displacement field, obtained by solving the equations of equilibrium in conjunction with the fiber-based constitutive model, and the measured displacement field at the bead locations. We employ a gradient-based minimization method to solve this problem and determine the gradient efficiently by solving for the appropriate adjoint field. We apply this algorithm to problems with experimentally observed cell geometries and synthetic, albeit realistic, traction fields to gauge its sensitivity to noise, and quantify the impact of using an incorrect constitutive model: the so-called model error. We conclude that the approach is robust to noise, yielding about 10% error in tractions for 5% displacement noise. We also conclude that the impact of model error is significant, where using a nonlinear exponential hyperelastic model instead of the fiber-based model, can lead to more than 100% error in the traction field. These results underline the importance of using appropriate constitutive models in 3DTFM, especially in fibrous ECM constructs.",

She described significant weight loss, shortness of breath, yellow productive sputum, fever, and chills from 4 months ago. The empirical antibiotic therapy didn't cause a significant improvement in the patient's health condition. Also, the sputum smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) tests were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Computed tomography scanning identified a consolidation at the right upper lobe which was susceptible to malignancy. Non-caseous granulomatous inflammation with the presence of acid-fast bacillus was detected in the biopsies. Therefore, the patient's sputum was reexamined. Although PCR was negative, both smear and culture became positive. PCR-based amplification of a 596 bp fragment of 16S rRNA gene of the isolated bacteria, followed by almost full 16S rRNA sequencing, identified the Mycobacterium fortuitum strain. No malignant cell was detected at pathology evaluations. Due to the increase of NTM attributed diseases which can exhibit negative PCR for MTB and low reliability of negative results of sputum smear and culture, multiple repetitions of the sputum evaluations and, utilizing from 16S rRNA sequencing is recommended to diagnose NTM related lung disease.Copyright &#169; 2019 Tuberculosis Association of India.

        "abstract": "Patient and family advisors (PFAs) contributed to the development of the Ontario Cancer Plan IV (OCP IV), a 4-year strategic plan for Ontario, Canada's cancer system produced by Cancer Care Ontario.To understand the barriers and facilitators PFAs experience when they are engaged in health-care system planning and provide recommendations for future engagement.Patient and family advisors who had an ongoing involvement in the development of the OCP IV were invited to take part in an interview. Qualitative data were analyzed for emergent themes and recommendations were generated.Key emergent themes highlighted necessary elements for effective engagement of PFAs. These included rapport (feeling valued, included as an equal and having supportive interpersonal relationships), communication (clarity and transparency, shared language and understanding, feeling heard, and effective teleconferencing), and leadership (from PFAs and staff). Recommendations for optimizing PFA engagement in health-care system planning were generated.Patient and family advisors can be effectively engaged in system-level strategic planning by building reciprocal rapport, effective communication, and strong leadership. Notably, developing \"systems literacy\" in PFAs is key to ensuring the voices of patients and their families are heard and reflected in health-care system plans.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to systematically characterize the content and patterning of companion's communicative behavior during oncology consultations for older African-American male patients. Companions and family members often play an important role in patient-centered communication for patients with cancer. Despite their disproportionate cancer burden, little is known about how companions facilitate patient-provider communication for older African-American men with cancer. This study represents a secondary qualitative analysis of 14 video-recorded doctor patient-companion medical visits for African-American male patients with cancer. Videos were captured with consent and institutional review board approval at a Midwest comprehensive cancer center between 2002 and 2006. These medical visits were transcribed, deidentified, and analyzed for the content, frequency, co-occurrence, and thematic clustering of companions' active participation behaviors during the interaction. Results were well aligned with existing studies on accompanied oncology visits. Patients were on average, 60.14 years old and all but one of the 16 companions was a woman. A total 782 companion behaviors were coded across 14 medical interactions. While companions communicated directly with providers (eg, asking questions, providing medical history) and directly with patients (eg, clarifying information, giving advice), there was a lack of triadic communication. This study clarifies the role of mainly spousal companions as important intermediaries in the patient-provider communication dynamic for older African-American men with cancer.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

While the causes of cardiomyopathy continue to be elucidated, current evidence suggests that aberrant bioactive lipid signaling plays a crucial role as a component of cardiac pathophysiology. Sphingolipids have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, as they regulate numerous cellular processes that occur in primary and secondary cardiomyopathies. Experimental evidence gathered over the last few decades from both in vitro and in vivo model systems indicates that inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis attenuate a variety of cardiomyopathic symptoms. In this review, we focus on various cardiomyopathies in which sphingolipids have been implicated and the potential therapeutic benefits that could be gained by targeting sphingolipid metabolism.Copyright &#169; 2020 The Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Breast diseases in women, whether benign or malignant, are very commonly encountered. The breast is the commonest site for female cancer in Egypt (38.8%). Breast cancer screening can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the survival rate for this malignancy. Mammogram can be used as a screening technique beside its role as diagnostic, especially in women over 40 years of age.To assess knowledge, attitude and practice regarding breast cancer and awareness about mammogram as a screening method among a group of females attending Ain Shams University outpatient clinics.A cross-sectional study was performed from August to September 2017. A systematic random sample was taken from attending females (18-70 years) in Ain Shams University outpatient clinics (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics Hospital, and Maternity hospital). They were interviewed using a questionnaire inquiring about sociodemographic background, participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards breast cancer and its screening.The mean age &#177; SD of attending females (18-70 years) was 37 &#177; 11 years. Most study participants had correct information about mammography. They showed poor knowledge level about risk factors. Mass media such as TV and internet were identified as the main source of information on breast cancer by 43% and 23.9%, respectively. In general, participants had positive attitude towards breast cancer screening by mammography. Around 90% agreed that mammogram was the best way to find a very small lump in the breast, and 91.4% agreed that women who have regular screening by mammogram have better disease outcome than those who do not screen. Regarding mammography practice rate, a small percent of participants (8.1%) was advised by their doctors to conduct a screening mammography. The level of knowledge was significantly and positively correlated with their attitude towards breast cancer screening.The poor knowledge and practices of women illustrate the need for health education program directed to Egyptian females to improve their knowledge about breast cancer-especially its risk factors-and its screening. Using TV and Internet as media for spreading information about this disease is crucial.",

Most existing methods focus on the local network structure and incur heavy computational costs for the large-scale problem. In this work, we propose a novel prior model for Bayesian network marker selection in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework: the Thresholded Graph Laplacian Gaussian (TGLG) prior, which adopts the graph Laplacian matrix to characterize the conditional dependence between neighboring markers accounting for the global network structure. Under mild conditions, we show the proposed model enjoys the posterior consistency with a diverging number of edges and nodes in the network. We also develop a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) for efficient posterior computation, which is scalable to large-scale networks. We illustrate the superiorities of the proposed method compared with existing alternatives via extensive simulation studies and an analysis of the breast cancer gene expression dataset in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).",

Ultimately, MWCNT-MTX and MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA were synthesized. Methotrexate release studies were conducted in PBS and cytotoxic studies were carried out by means of the MTT tassay. Methotrexate release studies from these two carriers demonstrated that the attachment of PEI-FA onto MWCNT-MTX reduces the release rate of methotrexate. The IC50 of MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA and MWCNT-MTX have been calculated as follows: 9.89 &#177; 0.38 and 16.98 &#177; 1.07 &#181;g/mL, respectively. Cytotoxic studies on MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA and MWCNT-MTX in the presence of an IR laser showed that at high concentrations, they had similar toxicities due to the MWCNT's photothermal effect. Targeting effect studies in the presence of the IR laser on the cancer cells have shown that MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA, MWCNT-MTX, and f-MWCNT have triggered the death of cancer cells by 55.11 &#177; 1.97%, 49.64 &#177; 2.44%, and 37 &#177; 0.70%, respectively. The release profile of MTX in MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA showed that the presence of PEI acts as a barrier against release and reduces the MTX release rate. In the absence of a laser, MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA exhibits the highest degree of cytotoxicity. In the presence of a laser, the cytotoxicity of MWCNT-MTX and MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA has no significant difference. Targeting studies have shown that MWCNT-MTX-PEI-FA can be absorbed by cancer cells exclusively.",

The designed sequence contained 24 amino acid residues (P24), in which Lys, His, Ser residues were substituted with Arg and also, hydrophobic Phe was replaced with Trp. Recombinant production of P24 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 using pTYB21, containing chitin binding domain and intein sequence at the N-terminus of the peptide gene, resulted in 1 &#956;g mL-1 product from culture. Chitin column chromatography, followed by online peptide cleavage with thiol reducing agent was applied to purify the peptide. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated using five bacteria strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumonia, E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Designed AMP exhibited promising antimicrobial activities with low minimum inhibitory concentration, in the range of 64-256 &#181;g/mL. P24 showed potent antimicrobial activity preferably against Gram-positive bacteria, and more potent than pexiganan as a successful Magainin II analog for topical infections.

The results of the present study revealed that the inhibition of CDKs using pan-CDK inhibitor AT7519, as revealed by the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest as well as the reduction of cyclins expression, resulted in decreased survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived KG-1 cells, either in the context of single agent or in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO). Apart from alterations in the expression of proliferation and apoptotic genes, the anti-survival property of AT7519 was coupled with the inhibition of autophagy-related genes. Notably, we found that the blockage of autophagy system in KG-1 cells resulted in a superior cytotoxic effect, introducing autophagy as a probable suppressor of cell death. As far as we are aware, to date, no study has reported the contributory mechanisms correlated with the less sensitivity of acute leukemia cells to AT7519 and our study suggested for the first time that the activation of both PI3K and c-Myc signaling pathways could overshadow, at least partly, the efficacy of this agent in KG-1 cells. Overall, due to the pharmacologic safety of AT7519, our study proposed this inhibitor as a promising agent for the treatment of AML either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy.",

Due to its applications in civilian and also military activity, DU emerged as environmental pollutant. The exposure to DU can occur via external or internal pathways. In external exposure, mainly beta radiation from the decay products contributes to DU toxicity. Internal exposure to DU is more important and can occur through ingestion of DU-contaminated water and food and inhalation of DU aerosols. There is limited information about health effects and mechanism of DU after environmental exposure. Kidney is reported as the main target organ for the chemical toxicity of this metal that was reported in Persian Gulf syndrome. Alterations in behavior, some neurologic adverse effects, immunotoxicity, embryo-toxicity and hepatotoxicity were observed in chronic exposure to DU. Also, the increased risk of cancer was revealed in epidemiological and experimental studies. Several mechanisms were suggested for DU toxicity such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial toxicity and inflammation. In fact, uranium like other toxic heavy metals can induce oxidative damage and apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and inflammatory response. In this review, we have discussed the kinetic of DU including source and exposure pathway. In addition, the health effects of DU and also its toxic mechanism have been highlighted.",

Heterogeneity in reporting study design elements and conducting statistical analyses is often observed for the same study design and study objective in medical literatures. Sometimes, researchers face a lot of predicaments using appropriate statistical approaches highlighted by methodologists for a specific study design either due to lack of accessibility or understanding of statistical methods or unavailability of checklists related to design and analysis in a concise format. The purpose of this review is to provide the checklist of statistical analysis and methods in biomedical research (SAMBR) to applied researchers.We initially identified the important steps of reporting design features that may influence the choice of statistical analysis in biomedical research and essential steps of data analysis of common studies. We subsequently searched for statistical approaches employed for each study design/study objective available in publications and other resources. Compilation of these steps produced SAMBR guidance document, which includes three parts. Applied researchers can use part (A) and part (B) of SAMBR to describe or evaluate research design features and quality of statistical analysis, respectively, in reviewing studies or designing protocols. Part (C) of SAMBR can be used to perform essential and preferred evidence-based data analysis specific to study design and objective.We believe that the statistical methods checklists may improve reporting of research design, standardize methodological practices, and promote consistent application of statistical approaches, thus improving the quality of research studies. The checklists do not enforce the use of suggested statistical methods but rather highlight and encourage to conduct the best statistical practices. There is a need to develop an interactive web-based application of the checklists for users for its wide applications.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Appropriate statistical methods in the context of study design and objectives are required for obtaining reliable results and valid inference. Unfortunately, variable methods for the same study objectives and dubious reporting have been noticed in the survival analysis of oncology research. Applied researchers often face difficulties in selecting appropriate statistical methods due to the complex nature of cancer studies.In this report, we describe briefly major statistical issues along with related challenges in planning, designing, and analyzing of survival studies.

For a continuous-scale diagnostic test, classical likelihood-based inference about the area under the ROC curve can be inaccurate, in particular when the sample size is small, and higher order inferential procedures have been proposed.The goal of this paper is to illustrate higher order likelihood procedures for parametric inference in small samples, which provide accurate point estimates and confidence intervals for the volume under the ROC surface.Simulation studies are performed in order to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed methodology, and two applications to real data are discussed.We show that likelihood modern inference provide refinements to classical inferential results. Furthermore, the freely available R package likelihoodAsy makes now their use almost automatic.Modern likelihood inference based on higher-order asymptotic methods for the area under the ROC surface provide refinements to classical inferential results. A possible limitation of higher-order asymptotic methods for practical use is that their software implementation can be awkward.

Lymphocyte infiltration, an important indicator of immune activity and disease aggressiveness, can be identified by gene expression profiling of immune-related genes of tumours which may prove useful in prognosis of patients.The aim of this study is to identify and validate a novel immune gene-based prognostic signature for OC.Here, we extracted the expression of immune-related genes and performed the Cox regression analysis and identified five genes with significant correlation with survival in training cohort of patients (n&#160;=&#160;286). We utilised regression coefficient and expression level of five genes to calculate immune prognostic signature (IPS) score for OC patients. In univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis with other clinicopathological factors, we showed that IPS is an independent predictor of survival (P value <0.01). More importantly, we utilised 404 patients from TCGA dataset as the validation cohort and validated the survival capability of IPS in the univariate and multivariate analysis (P value <0.001). Interestingly, KM analysis showed a significant difference in survival of patients with high and low IPS score in both datasets (training dataset P value <0.01, validation dataset P value <0.01). Further, we showed that all the five genes are differentially expressed and involved in immune modulation among other pathways. Interestingly, GSEA analysis showed that high IPS patients had low immune activity and activated EMT and other oncogenic pathways.In summary, we have developed and validated robust immune-related gene-based prognostic signature to identify the OC patients with high immune activity who can be taken for immunotherapy.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Cox regression is the most widely used survival model in oncology. Parametric survival models are an alternative of Cox regression model. In this study, we have illustrated the application of semiparametric model and various parametric (Weibull, exponential, log-normal, and log-logistic) models in lung cancer data by using R software.The aim of the study is to illustrate responsible factors in lung cancer and compared with Cox regression and parametric models.A total of 66 lung cancer patients of African Americans (AAs) (data available online at http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org) was used. To identify predictors of overall survival, stage of patient, sex, age, smoking, and tumor grade were taken into account. Both parametric and semiparametric models were fitted. Performance of parametric models was compared by Akaike information criterion (AIC). \"Survival\" package in R software was used to perform the analysis. Posterior density was obtained for different parameters through Bayesian approach using WinBUGS.The illustration about model fitting problem was documented. Parametric models were fitted only for stage after controlling for age. AIC value was minimum (462.4087) for log-logistic model as compared with other parametric models. Log-logistic model was the best fit for AAs lung cancer data under study.Exploring parametric survival models in daily practice of cancer research is challenging. It may be due to many reasons including popularity of Cox regression and lack of knowledge about how to perform it. This paper provides the application of parametric survival models by using freely available R software with illustration. It is expected that this present work can be useful to apply parametric survival models.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Early diagnosis and improved therapeutic options have contributed to prolonged survival in male genitourinary cancer. However, these cancer survivors may die due to other causes.This work is aimed to explore the death patterns among male genitourinary cancer patients due to other causes. The occurrence of death not related to cancer is defined as competing risk (CR).Data extracted between 1973 and 2014 for male patients (n = 638 393) diagnosed with genitourinary cancer and registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program were included for analysis. A CR analysis was performed to explore the death patterns due to cancer or otherwise. Our study evidenced a huge proportion of patients' death due to associated factors including but not limited to cancer. Interestingly, the computed hazard ratios obtained in cancers of male organ sites such as prepuce, glans penis, penis, and spermatic cord were 1.28 (0.98-1.67), 1.53 (1.33-1.77), 1.35 (0.19-1.53), and 1.57 (1.24-2.0), respectively. However, the hazard ratios evaluated on factors other than cancer in the same organ sites were 0.95 (0.76-1.18), 1.14 (0.99-1.3), 1.09 (0.97-1.22), and 1.12 (0.86-1.46), respectively.This study shows that among the male genitourinary cancer patients, the significant proportion of deaths occurs due to reasons unrelated to cancer. It can be concluded that the magnitude of death due to only genitourinary cancer is minimal and is not as high as documented in the earlier literature.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the main health burden worldwide, which can cause major economic and physiological problems along with relatively high rate of mortality. It is important to develop new methods for the localized delivery of recombinant protein therapeutics, in large part due to the failure of conventional therapies in most cases. Since E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) does not produce any virulence factors, here we used these bacteria with the light-activated promoter system to deliver therapeutic agents in the desired location and time. Methods: In this study, Staphylococcus aureus alpha hemolysin (SAH), after codon usage optimization, was cloned into blue light activating vector (pDawn) and transferred to EcN strain. Then, the functionality and cytotoxicity of secreted alpha hemolysin was evaluated in the SW480 colon cancer cell line by using different experiments, including blood agar test, flow cytometry analysis, and DAPI staining. Results: Our findings revealed that EcN can produce functional SAH under the blue light irradiation against SW480 cancer cells. Moreover, cytotoxicity assays confirmed the dose- and time-dependent toxicity of this payload (SAH) against SW480 cancer cells. Conclusion: Based on our results, EcN is proposed as an appropriate light-activated vehicle for delivery of anticancer agents to the target cancer cells/tissues.&#169; 2020 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Defining research priorities in intensive care is key to determining appropriate allocation of funding. Several topics were identified from the 2014 James Lind Alliance priority setting exercise conducted with the Intensive Care Society. The James Lind Alliance process included significant (and vital) patient/public contribution, but excluded professionals without a bedside role. As a result it may have failed to identify potential early-stage translational research topics, which are more likely identified by medical and/or academic members of relevant specialist basic science groups. The objective of the present project was to complement the James Lind Alliance project by generating an updated list of research priorities by facilitating academic research input.A survey was conducted by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to identify the key research priorities from intensive care clinicians, including allied health professionals and academics, along with any evolving themes arising from translational research. Feasibility of all identified topics were then discussed and allocated to themes by a joint clinical academics/NIHR focus group.The survey was completed by 94 intensive care clinicians (including subspecialists), academics and allied health professions. In total, 203 research questions were identified, with the top five themes focusing on: appropriate case selection (e.g. who and when to treat; 24%), ventilation (7%), sepsis (6%), delirium (5%) and rehabilitation (5%).Utilising a methodology distinct from that employed by the James Lind Alliance process, from a broad spectrum of intensive care clinicians/scientists, enabled identification of a variety of priority research areas. These topics can now inform not only the investigator-led research agenda, but will also be considered in due course by the NIHR for potential future funding calls.&#169; The Intensive Care Society 2019.",

        "title": "Acupuncture for Analgesia During Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor.",
        "abstract": "Background: Acupuncture has been widely studied, and theories regarding its analgesic mechanism of action have been proposed. It has been used for procedural analgesia; however, no reports of its use in urologic surgery have been reported. In this case report, we demonstrate how acupuncture can be used as an alternative to general anesthesia for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). This may serve as an attractive option for bladder cancer patients with medical comorbidities, which predispose them to high risk for general anesthesia. Case Presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian female with toxicant-induced loss of tolerance (TILT) was found to have a bladder mass. TURBT was discussed, and in light of her TILT syndrome, she elected to undergo the procedure with acupuncture in lieu of general anesthesia for fear of an adverse reaction. Acupuncture was performed by a trained practitioner with therapeutic needles placed in the ears, hands, abdomen, and lower extremities bilaterally. She was subsequently taken to the operating room where we performed a TURBT of a bladder tumor overlying the left ureteral orifice. The procedure was generally well tolerated and the patient experienced mild pain. There were no perioperative complications. The tumor was estimated to be 3&#8201;cm in largest diameter, and a total of 8&#8201;g of aggregate tissue was sent to our pathologists. Pathology analysis demonstrated adequate resection with detrusor muscle present in the sample. The bladder tumor was low-grade papillary urothelial cell carcinoma (Stage Ta). She has had tumor recurrence and has undergone repeat TURBT, but to date, she is 22 months free of bladder cancer. Conclusion: In this case report, we demonstrate that acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia for patients undergoing TURBT. Since tobacco use is prevalent among bladder cancer patients, many of these individuals have associated medical comorbidities, which predispose them to high risk with general anesthesia. Therefore, acupuncture may serve as an attractive alternative for certain patients in this population.Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",

It is a less-invasive surgical alternative to transurethral resection and surgical resection. Prostatic adenocarcinoma can incidentally be found in the enucleated tissue. Occasionally, nonadenocarcinomatous forms of neoplasia occur such as sarcoma. Case Presentation: Two male patients, both 65 years old, undergo HoLEP for gigantic prostates. The first patient presented with recurrent hematuria and clot retention. After HoLEP, the patient voiding symptoms improved. Pathologic immunostaining of the tissue showed spindle cell proliferation consistent with stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP). The second patient presented with acute urinary retention and subsequently underwent HoLEP. Pathologic examination of the enucleated tissue was consistent with prostatic stromal sarcoma. Conclusion: HoLEP is a well-established surgical treatment for gigantic proliferations of benign prostatic tissue. Occasionally, patients who are candidates for HoLEP may have a rare underlying pathologic condition such as a sarcoma or a STUMP. Exclusion of underlying malignant processes in massive prostates is necessary before operating.Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",

Filariasis is an endemic disease in parts of India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. Filariasis is a progressive disease predominantly affecting the lymphoreticular system, which can result in genitourinary complications (hydrocele, scrotal pain, and infertility), lymphedema, and elephantitis. Retroperitoneal fibrosis has a broad etiology, including secondary to chronic infection. Currently an estimated 25 million men are suffering from lymphatic filariasis with urogenital involvement worldwide. Case Presentation: We present a rare case of a 40-year-old man presenting with fever, groin lymphadenopathy, and a history of infertility. Imaging confirmed significant hydronephrosis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Filariasis serology was positive. Prior bilateral testicular biopsy demonstrated chronic inflammation and atrophy. Disease course was not improved by empirical eradication and supportive retrograde ureteral stenting. The patient developed elephantitis and progressive retroperitoneal fibrosis leading to a solitary functioning right kidney with nephrostomy.

        "abstract": "Background: Upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUCs) are infrequent neoplasms occurring in the pelvis renalis or the ureter with an incidence between 5% and 10% of all urothelial carcinomas. In addition, a synchronous bilateral appearance is extremely rare with a quantity of only 1.6% of all UTUCs. Since an oncologically-safe treatment would be a radical nephroureterectomy, consequently leading to dialysis, a satisfying therapy is challenging. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with bilateral UTUCs at primary diagnosis and the sincere wish of a kidney-preserving treatment option. Therefore, multiple endoscopic ablations with a laser were performed, until a tumor-free status could be achieved. Owing to her medical history with a gynecologic tumor, a genetic examination was initiated, revealing the diagnosis of a Lynch syndrome. Based on promising results in the first 3-month follow-up we decided on a short-term endoscopic follow-up to keep control of tumor progression by endoscopic ablations when needed. In this way we are trying to spare our patient the dialysis. Conclusions: An oncologically satisfying treatment for bilateral UTUCs stays a challenging problem in urology. Despite little available data and expected high recurrence rates, we decided on an endoscopic kidney-preserving therapy approach to eventually spare our patient the dialysis. Up to now we are pleasantly surprised about the result and since a short-term follow-up is possible in our department, we hope to attain endoscopic control of the tumor. In addition, we want to point out that genetic background might be underestimated and should be keep it in mind for special cases. In this way, an early detection of other related tumors or tumor detection in relatives could be possible through preventive checkups.Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",

Only 12 patients (3.8%) were exceptional survivors (MDS >10 years).The term \"chronic disease\" might be appropriate in selected MBC cases, bringing MBC into alignment with \"classical\" chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. However, most cases display fundamental differences with regard to temporal progression and above all the case fatality rate. More than 90% of patients in the \"chronic disease subgroup\" died of the disease with a MDS of 2-3 years (even those who underwent systemic palliative therapies). Doctors and patients might understand the term \"chronic disease\" differently. The term must be used sparingly and explained carefully in order to create a common level of communication based on a shared understanding which avoids awakening false hopes and fostering misleading expectations.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

        "abstract": "LCN1 (lipocalin-1), a gene that encodes tear lipocalin (or von Ebner's gland protein), is mainly expressed in secretory glands and tissues, such as the lachrymal and lingual gland, and nasal, mammary, and tracheobronchial mucosae. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Breast Carcinoma (BRCA) level 3 data revealed a relationship between LCN1 expression and survival in breast cancer patients.The &#967;2 test and Fisher exact test were applied to analyze the clinical data and RNA sequencing expression data, and the association between LCN1 expression and clinicopathologic features was determined. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of LCN1 was drawn to assess its ability as a diagnostic marker, and the optimal cutoff value was obtained from the ROC curve to distinguish groups with high and low LCN1 expression. Cox regression was used to compare both groups, and a log-rank test was applied to calculate p values and compare the -Kaplan-Meier curves. Furthermore, GEO datasets were employed for external data validation.Analysis of 1,104 breast cancer patients with a primary tumor revealed that LCN1 was overexpressed in breast cancer. High LCN1 expression was associated with clinicopathologic features and poor survival. Analyzing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of LCN1, it was found that its diagnostic ability was limited. Multivariate analysis indicated that LCN1 expression is an independent predictor of survival in breast cancer patients. Through validation in GEO datasets, LCN1 expression was higher in tumor than normal tissue of the breast. High LCN1 expression was associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients.High LCN1 expression is an independent prognosticator of a poor prognosis in breast cancer.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

        "abstract": "In some hospitals it is still common practice to carry out a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) if ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is determined in preoperative staging, although this is against international guidelines. The reason for this is because an infiltrative component can be demonstrated frequently in the final pathohistological examination. In this study, we wanted to investigate possible predictors for infiltrative growth, to select patients to do an SNB or to omit it.All patients with DCIS in the core needle biopsy (CNB), who were treated with surgery including an SNB, were included in a prospective data registry. Patient characteristics were collected through physical examination, mammography and ultrasonography. All characteristics of the DCIS were noted. After surgery, the pathological results were collected.From the 287 patients, 39 (13.6%) had an infiltrative component in the definitive pathological examination despite only DCIS in preoperative CNB. In total, there were only 14 (4.9%) positive SNBs, of which 11 patients had infiltrative growth in the breast tumor and 3 (1.2% of patients with DCIS alone in the final pathology) did not. In addition, characteristics of the CNB, including microcalcifications and comedonecrosis, did not show a statistically significant higher risk for infiltration.Considering the low rates of positive SNBs in our population, we think that an SNB should not be performed in advance when DCIS is diagnosed, because if infiltrative growth is found in the final biopsy, an SNB could always be performed afterwards. Only if an SNB cannot be performed afterwards is an SNB indicated.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "abstract": "BRCA mutation carriers and women at high risk of breast/ovarian cancer are faced with the intricate question to opt for prophylactic surgeries and/or a periodic screening. The aim of this study was therefore to identify objective and emotional factors that have an impact on the decision-making process.Ninety-five women with BRCA mutations or women at increased breast/ovarian cancer lifetime risk were counseled at our outpatient department and either opted for prophylactic surgery or periodic screening. To identify the psychological factors that could have influenced the decision-making, a standardized questionnaire was applied. Additionally, clinical data were collected and were reviewed by a personal talk.Seventy-one of the patients opted for an increased surveillance only, 21 for prophylactic surgeries. Positive predictors for prophylactic surgeries were sociodemographic characteristics such as parity and objective variables such as verified mutation status. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the need for safety in health issues has been the only significant psychological predictor of surgery beyond the objective factors. Fear of surgical procedures, menopausal symptoms after surgery, loss of attractiveness, or fear of interferences with sexual life did not significantly affect decision-making.Decision-making towards prophylactic surgeries is influenced by objective but also emotional factors. Knowing that fear and anxiety also have an important impact on decision-making, distinct counselling about the procedures, the subsequent risk reduction as well as the psychological effects of prophylactic surgeries are essential.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

The literature suggests incidence rates of 1:500 to 1:3,000 which, however, do not seem to match the very small number of cases reported.The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of morphea following irradiation of the breast in order to generate more evidence about the frequency of this serious and mutilating complication.Retrospective analysis of patient data who underwent adjuvant radiotherapy in the period 2009-2018 following breast-conserving surgery and who made use of the recommended radiooncology follow-up examinations in 2018. Analysis was done by descriptive statistics.Of a total of 5,129 patients who had undergone radiotherapy over a 10-year period, follow-up data were available in 2,268 patients. In 2,236 patients (98.6%) the breast had been irradiated using conventional fractionation schemes with a total dose of 50-50.4 Gy; 32 (1.4%) were given a total dose of 40.05 Gy in 15 fractions. During the observation period, 6 patients were diagnosed with morphea (4 unilateral and 2 bilateral) by punch biopsies resulting in a cumulative incidence proportion of 0.26% (95% CI: 0.24-0.28), translating into 1 case for every 378 irradiated patients.In the case studies reported to date, morphea is described as a very rare complication. In contrast, our data suggest a cumulative incidence of 1:378, which is higher than other authors have estimated. This leads us to suspect that in a large number of patients, morphea is incorrectly diagnosed as an infection (in the early stages) and radiation-induced fibrosis (in later stages).Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

The QoL subanalysis presented here examined the impact of IM packages on QoL and the association between QoL and compliance. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires were completed at baseline, 12 and 24 months, or study termination to assess health-related QoL and disease-related symptoms.Of the 4,844 patients randomized to standard therapy or standard therapy + IM packages (1:1), 4,253 were available for QoL analysis. No difference in QoL was observed between groups at baseline. IM packages did not have a statistically significant impact on patient QoL at the 12- or 24-month follow-up. Compliant patients experienced improvement in multiple items across the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 scales at 12 months. However, those results should be interpreted carefully due to limitations in the statistical analyses.Provision of IM packages did not influence patients' QoL or satisfaction with care during AI therapy. Compliant patients appear to experience improved QoL compared to noncompliant patients, perhaps indicating a more self-empowered perception of their condition.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

A meta-analysis was performed to understand the changes in the sleep quality of women with breast cancer during their treatment period. In a systematic literature review in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines, we searched for articles published between 2000 and 2018 in databases. A total of 12 study articles were included. The standardized mean differences of the pooling effect size of sleep quality between the period before treatment and 1-8 weeks, 9-16 weeks, 17-24 weeks, and 25-56 weeks after the commencement of treatment were -0.020, -0.162, 0.075, and 0.216, respectively. Although the differences were not statistically significant, in view of the heterogeneity among the studies, we conducted further analysis using a linear mixed effect model. The overall results indicated poorer sleep quality as time passed from the start of the first treatment (p = 0.014). The results of this study revealed that patients experienced better sleep quality in the initial months after the beginning of treatment; however, their sleep quality became poorer between 4 months to approximately 1 year after the beginning of treatment, compared with the sleep quality before treatment, and continued to decline rather than improve during the follow-up period.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

        "abstract": "Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging can simultaneously acquire functional metabolic information and anatomical information of the human body. How to rationally fuse the complementary information in PET/CT for accurate tumor segmentation is challenging. In this study, a novel deep learning based variational method was proposed to automatically fuse multimodality information for tumor segmentation in PET/CT. A 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) was first designed and trained to produce a probability map from the CT image. The learnt probability map describes the probability of each CT voxel belonging to the tumor or the background, and roughly distinguishes the tumor from its surrounding soft tissues. A fuzzy variational model was then proposed to incorporate the probability map and the PET intensity image for an accurate multimodality tumor segmentation, where the probability map acted as a membership degree prior. A split Bregman algorithm was used to minimize the variational model. The proposed method was validated on a non-small cell lung cancer dataset with 84 PET/CT images. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1). Only a few training samples were needed for training the designed network to produce the probability map; 2). The proposed method can be applied to small datasets, normally seen in clinic research; 3). The proposed method successfully fused the complementary information in PET/CT, and outperformed two existing deep learning-based multimodality segmentation methods and other multimodality segmentation methods using traditional fusion strategies (without deep learning); 4). The proposed method had a good performance for tumor segmentation, even for those with Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake inhomogeneity and blurred tumor edges (two major challenges in PET single modality segmentation) and complex surrounding soft tissues (one major challenge in CT single modality segmentation), and achieved an average dice similarity indexes (DSI) of 0.86 &#177; 0.05, sensitivity (SE) of 0.86 &#177; 0.07, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.87 &#177; 0.10, volume error (VE) of 0.16 &#177; 0.12, and classification error (CE) of 0.30 &#177; 0.12.",

We propose a synthetic data approach, which consists of creating m additional synthetic data observations, and then analyzing the combined dataset of size n+m to estimate the parameters of the Y|X, B model. This combined dataset of size n+m now has missing values of B form of the observations, and is analyzed using methods that can handle missing data (e.g. multiple imputation). We present simulation studies and illustrate the method using data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Though the synthetic data method is applicable to a general regression context, to provide some justification, we show in two special cases that the asymptotic variance of the parameter estimates in the Y|X, B model are identical to those from an alternative constrained maximum likelihood estimation approach.

Computational methods have been developed for eQTL mapping using gene expression data from microarray or RNA-seq technology. Application of these methods for eQTL mapping in tumor tissues is problematic because tumor tissues are composed of both tumor and infiltrating normal cells (e.g. immune cells) and eQTL effects may vary between tumor and infiltrating normal cells. To address this challenge, we have developed a new method for eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data from tumor samples. Our method separately estimates the eQTL effects in tumor and infiltrating normal cells using both total expression and allele-specific expression (ASE). We demonstrate that our method controls type I error rate and has higher power than some alternative approaches.

Logistic regression analyses were performed to test different clinical factors as predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) and build nomograms. Calibration curves were used to assess the concordance between the predictive value and the true risk. Decision curves were created to measure the overall net benefit.The prostate cancer (PCa) and CSPCa detection rates were 37.2% (81 of 218) and 23.9% (52 of 218) in the PI-RADS v2, score 3, cohort. More PCa cases (61.7%; 50 of 81) and CSPCa cases (75%; 39 of 52) were found in the peripheral zone than in the transitional zone. Multivariate analysis showed that age, prostate-specific antigen density, lesion region, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were predictive factors for CSPCa and PCa. Internally validated calibration curves showed that the predicted risk of CSPCa was closer to the actual probability when the threshold was > 60%. Decision curves showed that a better net benefit was achieved when the model was used to guide clinical practice.More cases of PCa and CSPCa were seen in the peripheral zone than in the transitional zone among patients with PI-RADS v2, score 3. The positive predictive value for a positive ADC (< 900 &#956;m2/s) for the detection of CSPCa and PCa improved with an increasing prostate-specific antigen density. Biopsy can be avoided if the equivocal lesion has a negative ADC (> 900 &#956;m2/s) and was in the transition zone.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Four cohorts were generated: (1) all patients, (2) grade 2 only, (3) grade 2 status post-subtotal resection only, (4) and grade 3 only. The association between adjuvant RT use and overall survival (OS) was assessed using multivariate Cox and propensity score matched analyses.A total of 1787 patients were included in cohort 1, of which 856 patients (48%) received adjuvant RT and 931 (52%) were observed. Approximately two-thirds of tumors were supratentorial and 80% were grade 2. Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 included 1471, 345, and 316 patients, respectively. There was no significant association between adjuvant RT use and OS in multivariate or propensity score matched analysis in any of the cohorts. Older age, male sex, urban location, higher comorbidity score, earlier year of diagnosis, and grade 3 were associated with increased risk of death.This large NCDB study did not demonstrate a significant association between adjuvant RT use and OS for adults with intracranial ependymoma, including for patients with grade 2 ependymoma status post-subtotal resection.

        "abstract": "Background: Noncontact Electro Capacitive Cancer Therapy (ECCT) is a novel treatment modality in cancer. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) has a major role in the outgrowth of metastatic breast cancer. Interleukin 18 (IL18) plays a role in macrophage alteration, which leads to excessive angiogenesis. This study aims to elaborate on the association of CCL2, IL18, IL23&#945;, and TNF-&#945; (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) expression with the anti-proliferative effect of ECCT in rat breast tumor tissue. &#160; Methods: Low intensity (18 Vpp) and intermediate frequency (150 kHz) alternating current-electric field (AC-EF) between two capacitive electrodes were exposed as external EF to a rat cage. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups of six replicates. Breast tumor tissues were collected from 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rats. Two groups were non DMBA-induced rats without ECCT exposure (NINT) and with (NIT). The other two groups were DMBA-induced rats without ECCT exposure (INT) and with (IT). Mammary glands and breast tumor tissues were collected from each group and preserved. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining were performed on paraffin sections of tissues using anti-PCNA, anti-ErbB2, anti-Caspase3, and anti-CD68. CCL2, IL18, IL23&#945;, and TNF-&#945; mRNA relative expressions were analyzed using qRT-PCR. Results: ECCT exposure may cause the reduction of PCNA protein expression as well as ErbB2 on breast tumor tissues, but it causes the increase of Caspase3 and macrophage CD68 protein. In rat breast tumor tissues of IT groups, the mRNA expression of CCL2 and IL18 are significantly down-regulated, in contrast with the up-regulated expression of these cytokines in tumor tissues of the INT group. IL23&#945; and TNF- &#945; expression remained similar in both groups. Conclusion: CCL2 and IL18 expressions have an association with the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation affected by ECCT exposure.Copyright: &#169; 2020 Pratiwi R et al.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease in a large part due to the systemic nature at the time of diagnosis. In those patients who undergo a potentially curative resection of pancreatic cancer, the overwhelming majority will have systemic relapse. Circulating tumor cells are an important mediator of the development of metastases. Circulating tumor cells have been identified in patients with clinically localized resectable pancreatic cancer and exist as several phenotypes. Mesenchymal and stem cell-like phenotypes of circulating tumor cells predict early recurrence and worse survival. This review focuses on the current understanding of circulating tumor cells in pancreatic cancer and how this information can be used in developing more effective therapy in the future.&#169; 2019 The Authors.",

        "title": "A Systematic Review of Treatment Options for Grieving Older Adults.",
        "abstract": "a)The purpose of this systematic review was to characterize the studies published on grief interventions for bereaved older adults in the last 5 years. Grief intervention studies were included that exclusively focused on older adults as well as those that included older adults in their samples, in order to summarize the most up-to-date treatment options available for bereaved older adults.b)Twenty-four articles that investigated grief interventions in older adults were identified. Generally, findings suggest viable treatment approaches for bereaved older adults are those incorporating behavioral activation and guidance on restoration-oriented coping. However, similar to studies of broader adult populations, grief interventions had small effects on grief-related symptoms in older adults. Few studies examined age as a moderator of treatment effects. Studies varied greatly by study design, sample size, and outcomes measured, which all likely impacted the efficacy of results.c)This review suggests that, while there has been a growing focus on older adults, who have unique vulnerabilities in bereavement, the evidence-base of efficacious interventions for this population is limited. Given the need for specialized bereavement support for older adults will increase in the coming years, future research should prioritize rigorous investigations of grief treatment options leveraging technology to increase access and incorporate techniques that enhance engagement in life and connectedness for this vulnerable population.",

This article focuses on CHamoru, Guam's Indigenous people, and examines distal social determinants of health (SDOH) in the contested spaces of US territorial status and non-self-determining Indigenous nationhood. Published multi-disciplinary literature identified ways in which territorial status functions as an SDOH unique to non-self-determining Pacific Island nations. Indicated is the use of structural approaches that address mechanisms of US power and control, including economic policies that 'defacto' promote coca-colonisation and non-communicable diseases risk. Critical race theory centres race, colonisation and subversive narratives. In line with fourth-generation SDOH action-oriented research, we posit a CHamoru critical race theory model that weaves Indigenous, social work and public health perspectives. Lack of community input is a limitation of the current research. To assure relevance, the model will be vetted through community discussions. Our discussion guide may be tailored for other Indigenous communities. Social workers may play a meaningful role in promoting health equity through participatory action-oriented, cultural-political social work that upholds Indigenous self-determination and survivance in contested spaces.",

Parents of these children received written recommendations and education on the HPV vaccine. Fifteen parents consented to the HPV vaccine for their child, a 1400% increase in HPV vaccine acceptance when compared to the same time period in 2017.This study found that a SBHC practice initiative led to an increase in HPV vaccine acceptance. There was also an increase in the acceptance of other vaccines such as Tdap, MenACWY, and Influenza.Provider recommendation was influential in improving HPV vaccination rates.

        "abstract": "Menopause affects the quality of life of millions of women. With modern lifespan the postmenopausal attenuation of circulating estrogen levels can negatively impact a women's life for 30-40 years. The major hypoestrogenic consequence is hot flushes but decline in cognitive function, sleep disorders, depression/anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis are also characteristic for the menopause. Current treatments of hot flushes include estrogen therapy alone or in combination with progestins, soy products, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, with the exception of estrogens, none of these have satisfactory efficacy. But estrogens come with the unwanted side effects in the periphery, including stimulation of the uterus and breast leading to elevated cancer risk. Therefore, a tremendous effort has been devoted to developing safer therapies and the research has utilized classic rodent models of hot flush with considerable limitations. As hot flushes are primate-specific symptoms, the development of a non-invasive primate hot flush model would have a tremendous impact on drug development. Therefore, our aim was to develop such a non-human primate (NHP) model a hot flush that both recapitulates flushes women experience and is minimally invasive. We investigated if recent developments in thermal imaging have made it possible to accurately monitor skin temperature via camera imaging. In this study, the skin temperature of an ovariectomized rhesus monkey was measured continuously with an infrared camera in a freely moving animal over long time period. Following mapping skin temperatures of several areas of the neck and face we found that the nose of the monkeys showed that largest changes in skin temperature. In the ovariectomized monkey the temperature of the skin on the nose shows up to 9 &#176;C elevations representing hot flushes. In the untreated monkey, hot flushes occurred more frequently in late afternoon/early evening hours than in the morning and last for several minutes. We observed 58 flushes in the 64 evenings of observation. The average number of hot flushes was 0.51 per evening. Oral administration of biotin (niacin) for seven days exaggerated the number of hot flushes to 2.43 per evening. Oral treatment with estradiol benzoate prevented hot flushes and only 2 flushes were detected in the 12 evenings after treatment, averaging 0.17 per evening. The development of this NHP model of hot flush provides great hope for utilizing it for future drug development and mechanistic studied.",

        "abstract": "Active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is accompanied by increased appendicular and axial bone loss, closely associated to the degree of inflammation. The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway is important for maintaining peripheral tolerance, and its ligand PD-L2 has recently been associated with bone morphogenetic protein activity. Here, we report that PD-L2 plays a central role in RA osteoimmunology.Femoral bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone microstructure were evaluated by micro-CT in wild type (WT) and PD-L2-/- mice. Osteoclasts were generated from RA synovial fluid mononuclear cells and peripheral blood monocytes. The effects of recombinant PD-L2, was evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and the development of bone erosions in the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). Plasma soluble (s)PD-L2 levels were measured in patients with early (e)RA (n&#160;&#8203;=&#160;&#8203;103) treated with methotrexate alone or in combination with the TNF inhibitor Adalimumab.PD-L2-/- mice had a decreased BMD and deteriorated trabecular bone microstructure that was not related to the RANKL/OPG pathway. PD-L2 decreased TRAP activity in osteoclasts and decreased ACPA-induced erosions. In the RA synovial membrane PD-L2 was highly expressed especially in the lining layer and plasma sPD-L2 levels were increased in eRA patients and decreased with treatment. One-year sPD-L2 correlated inversely with erosive progression two years after treatment initiation with methotrexate and placebo.PD-L2 regulates bone homeostasis in RA. Our findings provide new insight into the relationship between the immune system and bone homeostasis, and suggest a potential therapeutic target for limiting inflammatory bone loss in RA.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

As a result of this resistance, autoreactive plasma cells survive conventional therapy, resulting in persistent autoantibody production and inflammation. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on normal and malignant plasma cells. Daratumumab is the first in class CD38-targeting monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). To evaluate the potential activity of daratumumab in antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders by targeting autoantibody-producing plasma cells, we evaluated serum levels of autoantibodies in MM patients during daratumumab treatment. We found that 6 out of 41 (15%) had detectable autoantibodies before initiation of daratumumab therapy, and that these autoantibodies rapidly disappeared in 5 out of 6 patients during daratumumab treatment. Our data provide support for the evaluation of daratumumab in patients with autoantibody-dependent autoimmune disorders.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases evolve from complex interactions between the immune system and self-antigens and involve several genetic attributes, environmental triggers and diverse cell types. Research using experimental mouse models has contributed key knowledge on the mechanisms that underlie these diseases in humans, but differences between the mouse and human immune systems can and, at times, do undermine the translational significance of these findings. The use of human immune system (HIS) mice enables the utility of mouse models with greater relevance for human diseases. As the name conveys, these mice are reconstituted with mature human immune cells transferred directly from peripheral blood or via transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells that nucleate the generation of a complex human immune system. The function of the human immune system in HIS mice has improved over the years with the stepwise development of better models. HIS mice exhibit key benefits of the murine animal model, such as small size, robust and rapid reproduction and ease of experimental manipulation. Importantly, HIS mice also provide an applicable in vivo setting that permit the investigation of the physiological and pathological functions of the human immune system and its response to novel treatments. With the gaining popularity of HIS mice in the last decade, the potential of this model has been exploited for research in basic science, infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity. In this review we focus on the use of HIS mice in autoimmune studies to stimulate further development of these valuable models.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

The primary endpoint was difference in 1-year cumulative probability of suppressing testosterone to &#8804;0.5&#160;ng/mL. Non-inferiority was to be established if the lower 95% confidence interval (CI) limit for difference in cumulative probability between the treatment arms was greater than -10%. Secondary endpoints included cumulative probability of prostate-specific-antigen-progression-free-survival (PSA-PFS). Safety was also assessed.Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between degarelix (n=142) and goserelin (n=141) treatment arms. The difference in cumulative probability of maintaining castrate levels from Day 28-364 was 3.6% (95% CI:-1.5%, 8.7%), demonstrating non-inferiority of degarelix. The cumulative probability of PSA-PFS at Day 364 was higher for degarelix (82.3%, 95% CI: 74.7%, 87.7%) versus goserelin (71.7%, 95% CI: 63.2%, 78.5%, p=0.038). Adverse events (AEs) were similar between treatment arms, except for more injection site reactions with degarelix versus goserelin. Four (2.8%) and nine (6.4%) patients discontinued due to AEs in degarelix and goserelin groups, respectively.Degarelix was non-inferior to goserelin in achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression at castrate levels during 1-year treatment.

During malignant transformation, an early metabolic switch diverts the dependence of normal prostate cells on aerobic glycolysis for the synthesis of and secretion of citrate towards a more energetically favorable metabolic phenotype, whereby citrate is actively oxidised for energy and biosynthetic processes (i.e. de novo lipogenesis). It is now clear that lipid metabolism is one of the key androgen-regulated processes in prostate cells and alterations in lipid metabolism are a hallmark of prostate cancer, whereby increased de novo lipogenesis accompanied by overexpression of lipid metabolic genes are characteristic of primary and advanced disease. Despite recent advances in our understanding of altered lipid metabolism in prostate tumorigenesis and cancer progression, the intermediary metabolism of the normal prostate and its relationship to androgen signaling remains poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the fundamental metabolic relationships that are distinctive in normal versus malignant prostate tissues, and the role of androgens in the regulation of lipid metabolism at different stages of prostate tumorigenesis.&#169; 2020 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

        "title": "Androgen receptor co-regulation in prostate cancer.",
        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) progression relies on androgen receptor (AR) action. Preventing AR's ligand-activation is the frontline treatment for metastatic PCa. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) that inhibits AR ligand-binding initially induces remission but eventually fails, mainly because of adaptive PCa responses that restore AR action. The vast majority of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) continues to rely on AR activity. Novel therapeutic strategies are being explored that involve targeting other critical AR domains such as those that mediate its constitutively active transactivation function, its DNA binding ability, or its interaction with co-operating transcriptional regulators. Considerable molecular and clinical variability has been found in AR's interaction with its ligands, DNA binding motifs, and its associated coregulators and transcription factors. Here, we review evidence that each of these levels of AR regulation can individually and differentially impact transcription by AR. In addition, we examine emerging insights suggesting that each can also impact the other, and that all three may collaborate to induce gene-specific AR target gene expression, likely via AR allosteric effects. For the purpose of this review, we refer to the modulating influence of these differential and/or interdependent contributions of ligands, cognate DNA-binding motifs and critical regulatory protein interactions on AR's transcriptional output, which may influence the efficiency of the novel PCa therapeutic approaches under consideration, as co-regulation of AR activity.&#169; 2020 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

        "abstract": "Civic engagement, like the broader phenomenon of social engagement, seems out of keeping with the alienating ethos of incarceration. We sought to learn which demographic and contextual factors predicted one form of civic engagement, voter registration, in a jail-incarcerated female population. A 158-item survey was administered to 261 adult women incarcerated in three Midwestern jails, September 2014 to March 2016, as part of a parent intervention study for cervical cancer prevention. Chi-square comparisons between a voter registered and a non-registered group yielded significant differences in five demographic and social context indicators, and a model for voter registration was estimated using multiple logistic regression. Total time incarcerated, having personal health insurance, being stably housed, and identifying as a Black woman contributed significantly to voter registration. We suggest that in a justice-involved group the community's facilitation of access to basic resources may trigger a reciprocal engagement in civic life, and we speculate that Black women may find belonging and motivation for engagement in resilient, long-standing sources outside official institutions. Our findings support the notion that meeting the basic needs of individuals post-incarceration can create healthier, more engaged communities.",

        "title": "Estimating Creatinine Clearance in the Nonsteady State: The Determination and Role of the True Average Creatinine Concentration.",
        "abstract": "Creatinine clearance is a tenet of nephrology practice. However, with just a single creatinine concentration included in the denominator of the creatinine clearance equation, the resulting value seems to apply only in the steady state. Does the basic clearance formula work in the nonsteady state, and can it recapitulate the kinetic glomerular filtration rate (GFR) equation? In the kinetic state, a nonlinear creatinine trajectory is reducible into a \"true average\" value that can be found using calculus, proceeding from a differential equation based on the mass balance principle. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we prove definitively that the true average is the correct creatinine to divide by, even as the mathematical model accommodates clinical complexities such as volume change and other factors that affect creatinine kinetics. The true average of a creatinine versus time function between 2 measured creatinine values is found by a definite integral. To use the true average to compute kinetic GFR, 2 techniques are demonstrated, a graphical one and a numerical one. We apply this concept to a clinical case of an individual with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis; despite the effects of hemodialysis on serum creatinine concentration, kinetic GFR was able to track the underlying kidney function and provided critical information regarding kidney function recovery. Finally, a prior concept of the maximum increase in creatinine per day is made more clinically objective. Thus, the clearance paradigm applies to the nonsteady state as well when the true average creatinine is used, providing a fundamentally valid strategy to deduce kinetic GFRs from serum creatinine trends occurring in real-life acute kidney injury and kidney recovery.&#169; 2019 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "In scientific disciplines, most postdoctoral fellowships focus on research training. Postdoctoral fellows (\"postdocs\") develop research expertise and research projects that they will use in future independent faculty positions. This research focus often precludes opportunities for undergraduate teaching. However, most academic faculty positions require faculty to teach at the undergraduate level. The result is that many postdocs are exceptionally well-qualified to meet the research expectations of future faculty positions, but lack experience and training in innovative and evidence-based undergraduate teaching strategies. Training in evidence-based teaching approaches can result in two tangible outcomes. First, the quality of applications by the postdocs for tenure-track faculty positions at institutions with substantive teaching expectations can be improved. Second, we can anticipate stronger alignment of teaching and learning expectations between new faculty and their undergraduate students. There are many programs that provide training in teaching to early career researchers. We describe the design and implementation of a mentored teaching experience that faced some unique challenges, including a large geographic distance between the postdocs and the teaching mentor and teaching site. We describe how we addressed the challenges, what the benefits to various stakeholders have been, and the key elements that contributed to the success of the program.",

Delayed Mohs surgery and skin substitute dressing were performed without neoplastic recurrence at 5 years of follow up. Conclu sion: Pigmented DFSP is a low-grade sarcoma that is very rare in pediatric patients. The classical and pigmented variants should be suspected in the presence of a single papulonodular lesion of slow and progressive growth, with presence of spindle cells with storiform pattern in the biopsy and positive immunohistochemical study for CD34. It is an entity with good prognosis, with little risk of recurren ce and metastasis, if complete excision is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Current methods to identify, classify, and predict tumor behavior mostly rely on histology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular determinants. However, better predictive markers are required for tumor diagnosis and evaluation. Due, in part, to recent technological advancements, metabolomics and lipid biomarkers have become a promising area in cancer research. Therefore, there is a necessity for novel and complementary techniques to identify and visualize these molecular markers within tumors and surrounding tissue.Since its introduction, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has proven to be a powerful tool for mapping analytes in biological tissues. By adding the label-free specificity of mass spectrometry to the detailed spatial information of traditional histology, hundreds of lipids can be imaged simultaneously within a tumor. MSI provides highly detailed lipid maps for comparing intra-tumor, tumor margin, and healthy regions to identify biomarkers, patterns of disease, and potential therapeutic targets. In this manuscript, recent advancement in sample preparation and MSI technologies are discussed with special emphasis on cancer lipid research to identify tumor biomarkers.MSI offers a unique approach for biomolecular characterization of tumor tissues and provides valuable complementary information to histology for lipid biomarker discovery and tumor classification in clinical and research cancer applications.&#169; 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GB, formally glioblastoma multiforme) is a malignant type of brain cancer that currently has no cure and is characterized by being highly heterogeneous with high rates of re-incidence and therapy resistance. Thus, it is urgent to characterize the mechanisms of GB pathogenesis to help researchers identify novel therapeutic targets to cure this devastating disease. Recently, a promising approach to identifying novel therapeutic targets is the integration of tumor omics data with clinical information using machine learning (ML) techniques.ML has become a valuable addition to the researcher's toolbox, thanks to its flexibility, multidimensional approach, and a growing community of users. The goal of this review is to introduce basic concepts and applications of ML for studying GB to clinicians and practitioners who are new to data science. ML applications include exploring large data sets, finding new relevant patterns, predicting outcomes, or merely understanding associations of the complex molecular networks presented within the tumor. Here, we review ML applications published between 2008 and 2018 and discuss ML strategies intending to identify new potential therapeutic targets to improve the management and treatment of GB.ML applications to study GB vary in purpose and complexity, with positive results. In GB studies, ML is often used to analyze high-dimensional datasets with prediction or classification as a primary goal. Despite the strengths of ML techniques, they are not fail-safe and methodological issues can occur in GB studies that use them. This is why researchers need to be aware of these issues when planning and appraising studies that apply ML to the study of GB.&#169; 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. Currently, the suggested line of action is the surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and treatment with the adjuvant temozolomide, a DNA alkylating agent. However, the ability of tumor cells to deeply infiltrate the surrounding tissue makes complete resection quite impossible, and, in consequence, the probability of tumor recurrence is high, and the prognosis is not positive. GBM is highly heterogeneous and adapts to treatment in most individuals. Nevertheless, these mechanisms of adaption are unknown.In this review, we will discuss the recent discoveries in molecular and cellular heterogeneity, mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and new technological approaches to identify new treatments for GBM. The combination of biology and computer resources allow the use of algorithms to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to identify potential therapeutic pathways and to identify new drug candidates.These new approaches will generate a better understanding of GBM pathogenesis and will result in novel treatments to reduce or block the devastating consequences of brain cancers.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The concept of tumour heterogeneity is not novel but is fast becoming a paradigm by which to explain part of the highly recalcitrant nature of aggressive malignant tumours. Glioblastoma is a prime example of such difficult-to-treat, invasive, and incurable malignancies. With the advent of the post-genomic age and increased access to next-generation sequencing technologies, numerous publications have described the presence and extent of intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity present in glioblastoma. Moreover, there have been numerous reports more directly correlating the heterogeneity of glioblastoma to its refractory, reoccurring, and inevitably terminal nature. It is therefore prudent to consider the different forms of heterogeneity seen in glioblastoma and how to harness this understanding to better strategize novel therapeutic approaches. One of the most central questions of tumour heterogeneity is how these numerous different cell types (both tumour and non-tumour) in the tumour mass communicate.This chapter provides a brief review on the variable heterogeneity of glioblastoma, with a focus on cellular heterogeneity and on modalities of communication that can induce further molecular diversity within the complex and ever-evolving tumour microenvironment. We provide particular emphasis on the emerging role of actin-based cellular conduits called tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) and tumour microtubes (TMs) and outline the perceived current problems in the field that need to be resolved before pharmacological targeting of TNTs can become a reality.We conclude that TNTs and TMs provide a new and exciting avenue for the therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma and that numerous inroads have already made into TNT and TM biology. However, to target TMs and TNTs, several advances must be made before this aim can become a reality.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The current special issue entitled \"Role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in carcinogenesis\" was designed to discuss the role of cell-to-cell communication, especially TNTs, in cancer pathogenesis. In addition, we discuss the exploitation of TNTs as a potential therapeutic target to prevent and reduce cancer incidence. It is accepted that cell-to-cell communication is essential for the development of multicellular systems, and it is coordinated by soluble factors, associated membrane proteins, exosomes, gap junction channels, and TNTs. An old belief in the cancer field is that cancer cells are \"disconnected\" from healthy cells, resulting in loss of cell-to-cell communication and neighbor control. However, recent data obtained from different kind of tumors indicate that TNTs and others forms of communication (exosomes and localized cell-to-cell communication) are highly expressed and functional during tumor development . In physiological conditions, TNTs are expressed by few cells, and their main function is to coordinate long-distance signaling. However, upon carcinogenesis, TNTs proliferate and provide an alternative route of communication to enable the transfer of several signaling molecules and organelles to spread disease and toxicity. We propose that TNTs and their cargo are an attractive therapeutic target to reduce or prevent cancer development. All these unique aspects of cell-to-cell diffusion and organelle sharing will be discussed in this special issue.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Additionally, in the era of emerging immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer, it is very important to follow the treatment outcome and also to predict the correct immunotherapeutic strategy in individual patients. There being enormous heterogeneity among tumors at different sites or between primary and metastatic tumors in the same individual, or interpatient heterogeneity, it is very important to study the tumor-immune interaction in the tumor microenvironment and beyond. Importantly, molecular tools and markers identified for such studies must be suitable for monitoring in a noninvasive manner.Recent studies have shown that the immune checkpoint molecules play a key role in the development and progression of tumors. In-depth studies of these molecules have led to the development of most of the cancer immunotherapeutic reagents that are currently either in clinical use or under different phases of clinical trials. Interestingly, many of these cell surface molecules undergo alternative splicing to produce soluble isoforms, which can be tracked in the serum of patients.Several studies demonstrate that the serum levels of these soluble isoforms could be used as noninvasive markers for cancer diagnosis and disease prognosis or to predict patient response to specific therapeutic strategies.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

One of the most cited is the FCR model.This study seeks to understand the nature of women's cognitive and emotional issues from FCR using specific guidance from the model by Lee-Jones and to provide suggestions for modifications to the model based on empirical results from the reported experiences of women living with breast cancer.A qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews was conducted at an urban hospital. Recruited by convenience sampling, 12 breast cancer survivors concerned with FCR and who had recently completed active treatment participated in the study. Seven thematic categories emerged from the women's descriptions of their cognitive and emotional experiences with FCR: (a) FCR is always there; (b) beliefs about risk of recurrence; (c) beliefs about eradication of cancer; (d) preferences not to seek information about recurrence; (e) derailment of normal life; (f) worries related to recurrence; and (g) need for support. Adjustments to the model by Lee-Jones et al1 specifically to women living with breast cancer include the addition of new variables-the fear is always present, a preference not to seek information, and the need for support beyond treatment-and the merging of two variables, anxiety and worry, as participants viewed these concepts as interchangeable and experienced in similar ways. Lastly, participants did not report any remorse related to not opting for more aggressive treatments.The refinement of a more comprehensive FCR theoretical model, such as through the modifications derived from this study, provides a deeper understanding of breast cancer survivors' experiences with FCR and can more effectively guide health care professionals to develop appropriately tailored interventions aimed at decreasing FCR levels.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "title": "Development of novel apoferritin formulations for antitumour benzothiazoles.",
        "abstract": "The benzothiazole structure is important in medicinal chemistry, and 5-fluoro-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) benzothiazole (GW 610) is of particular interest as it shows outstanding anticancer activity in sensitive breast and colorectal carcinoma cell lines via generation of lethal DNA adducts in sensitive cancer cells. Despite promising activity, poor water solubility limits its applications. The apoferritin (AFt) protein cage has been proposed as a robust and biocompatible drug delivery vehicle.Here, we aim to enhance solubility of GW 610 by developing amino acid prodrug conjugates and utilizing the AFt capsule as drug delivery vessel.The potent experimental antitumour agent, GW 610, has been successfully encapsulated within AFt with more than 190 molecules per AFt cage. The AFt-GW 610 complex exhibits dose-dependent growth inhibition and is more potent than GW 610 alone in 5/7 cancer cell lines. To enhance both aqueous solubility and encapsulation efficiency, a series of amino acid esters of GW 608 prodrug were synthesized via N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ester coupling to produce molecules with different polarity. A dramatic increase in encapsulation efficiency was achieved, with more than 380 molecules of GW 608-Lys molecules per AFt cage. Release studies show sustained release of the cargo over 12&#160;hours at physiologically relevant pH. The AFt-encapsulated amino acid modified GW 608 complexes are sequestered more rapidly and exhibit more potent anticancer activity than unencapsulated agent.These results indicate that AFt-encapsulation of GW 610 prodrug provides a biocompatible delivery option for this potent, selective experimental antitumour agent and for amino acid-modified GW 608. Of particular interest is the encapsulation efficiency and in vitro antitumour activity of AFt-GW 608-Lys, which warrants further preclinical evaluation.&#169; 2019 The Authors Cancer Reports Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Haematological malignancies harbouring rearrangements of the KMT2A gene represent a unique subtype of leukaemia, with biphenotypic clinical manifestations, a rapid and aggressive onset, and a generally poor prognosis. Chromosomal translocations involving KMT2A often cause the formation of oncogenic fusion genes, such as the most common translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) producing the KMT2A-AFF1 chimera.The aim of this study was to confirm and review the cytogenetic and molecular features of the KMT2A-rearranged RS4;11 cell line and put those in context with other reports of cell lines also harbouring a t(4;11) rearrangement.The main chromosomal rearrangements t(4;11)(q21;q23) and i(7q), described when the cell line was first established, were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and 24-colour karyotyping by M-FISH. Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were investigated by further FISH experiments, including the presence of trisomy 18 as a clonal abnormality and the discovery of one chromosome 8 being an i(8q), which indicates a duplication of the oncogene MYC. A homozygous deletion of 9p21 containing the tumour-suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B was also revealed by FISH. The production of the fusion transcript KMT2A-AFF1 arising from the der(11)t(4;11) was confirmed by RT-PCR, but sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed the presence of multiple isoforms. Two transcript variants, resulting from alternative splicing, were identified differing in one glutamine residue in the translated protein.As karyotype evolution is a common issue in cell lines, we highlight the need to monitor cell lines in order to re-confirm their characteristics over time. We also reviewed the literature to provide a comparison of key features of several cell lines harbouring a t(4;11). This would guide scientists in selecting the most suitable research model for this particular type of KMT2A-leukaemia.&#169; 2019 The Authors. Cancer Reports Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The human orphan receptor TLX (NR2E1) is a key regulator of neurogenesis, adult stem cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the genetic and transcriptomic events that occur following TLX overexpression in human cell lines.Here, we used cytogenetics and RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of TLX overexpression with an inducible vector system in the HEK 293T cell line.Conventional spectral karyotyping was used to identify chromosomal abnormalities, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on chromosome spreads to assess TLX DNA copy number. Illumina paired-end whole transcriptome sequencing was then performed to characterize recurrent genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels), expressed gene fusions, and gene expression profiles. Lastly, flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution. Intriguingly, we show that upon transfection with a vector containing the human TLX gene (eGFP-hTLX), an isochromosome forms on the long arm of chromosome 6, thereby resulting in DNA gain of the TLX locus (6q21) and upregulation of TLX. Induction of the eGFP-hTLX vector further increased TLX expression levels, leading to G0-G1 cell cycle arrest, genetic aberrations, modulation of gene expression patterns, and crosstalk with other nuclear receptors (AR, ESR1, ESR2, NR1H4, and NR3C2). We identified a 49-gene signature associated with central nervous system (CNS) development and carcinogenesis, in addition to potentially cancer-driving gene fusions (LARP1-CNOT8 and NSL1-ZDBF2) and deleterious genetic variants (frameshift insertions in the CTSH, DBF4, POSTN, and WDR78 genes).Taken together, these findings illustrate that TLX may play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis via genomic instability and perturbation of cancer-related processes.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Phase-change nanodroplets (PCNDs), which are liquid perfluorocarbon nanoparticles, have garnered much attention as ultrasound-responsive nanomedicines. The vaporization phenomenon has been employed to treat tumors mechanically. However, the ultrasound pressure applied to induce vaporization must be low to avoid damage to nontarget tissues.Here, we report that the pressure threshold for vaporization to induce cytotoxicity can be significantly reduced by selective intracellular delivery of PCNDs into targeted tumors.In vitro experiments revealed that selective intracellular delivery of PCNDs induced PCND aggregation specifically inside the targeted cells. This close-packed configuration decreased the pressure threshold for vaporization to induce cytotoxicity. Moreover, following ultrasound exposure, significant decrease was observed in the viability of cells that incorporated PCNDs (35%) but not in the viability of cells that did not incorporate PCNDs (88%).Intracellular delivery of PCNDs reduced ultrasound pressure applied for vaporization to induce cytotoxicity. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that prolonged PCND-cell incubation increased PCND uptake and aggregation. This aggregation effect might have contributed to the cytotoxicity threshold reduction effect.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Bone metastasis of prostate cancer is associated with pain and reduced overall survival (OS). Radium-223, which is expected to reduce bone pain and prolong OS, was recently approved in Japan.The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the bone scan index by comparing the outcomes and factors according to response in Japanese patients treated with radium-223.Twenty patients receiving radium-223 were divided into two groups according to whether they did or did not achieve a bone scan index decrease of at least one point (beneficial and non-beneficial groups, respectively). The clinical characteristics at baseline and after three and six treatment cycles were compared using &#967;2 tests and Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, and survival was estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, respectively. Fourteen (70%) and six patients (30%) were categorized into the beneficial and non-beneficial groups, respectively. Patients in the former group were significantly more likely to have a higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score and receive a greater number of radium-223 injections (P&#160;<&#160;0.05). Furthermore, patients in the beneficial group had a significantly longer OS (P&#160;<&#160;0.05). Regarding safety, one and three patients in the beneficial and non-beneficial groups, respectively, prematurely discontinued radium-223 because of an increased prostate-specific antigen level, decreased hemoglobin level, or femoral fracture.Radium-223 appears generally safe in this population. Patients with good bone scan index response have better performance status, receive more injections of radium-223, and achieve OS prolongation. Bone scan index is a useful biomarker of survival outcomes and can be a valuable assessment tool in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are treated with radium-223.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), overexpressed on prostate cancer (PCa), is a well-characterized cell surface protein to selectively diagnose PCa. PSMA's unique characteristics and its 1000-fold higher expression in PCa compared with other tissues renders it as a suitable biomarker for detection of PCa in its early stage. In this report, we critically analyze and recommend the requirements needed for the development of variety of PSMA-targeted molecular imaging agents based on antibodies, small molecule ligands, peptides, and aptamers. The targeting moieties are either conjugated to radionuclear isotopes or near-infrared agents for efficient diagnosis of PCa.From the analysis, it was found that several small molecule-derived PCa imaging agents are approved for clinical trials in Europe and the United States, and few are already in the clinical use for diagnosis of PCa. Even though 111In-labeled capromab pendetide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other engineered antibodies are available for detection of PCa, but high production cost, low shelf life (less than 1&#160;month at 4&#176;C), possibility of human immuno reactions, and low blood clearance rate necessitated a need for developing new imaging agents, which are serum stable, cost-effective, and possesses longer shelf life (6&#160;months), have fast clearance rate from nontargeted tissues during the diagnosis process. It is found that small molecule ligand-derived imaging agents possesses most of the desired properties expected for an ideal diagnostic agent when compared with other targeting moieties.This report discusses in detail the homing moieties used in the development of targeted diagnostic tools for detection of PCa. The merits and demerits of monoclonal antibodies, small molecule ligands, peptides, and aptamers for imaging of PCa and intraoperative guided surgery are extensively analyzed. Among all, urea-based ligands were found to be most successful in preclinical and clinical trials and show a major promise for future commercialization.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Locoregional control is associated with distant metastasis risk and survival after surgery.We aimed to evaluate whether Japanese standard postoperative radiotherapy after surgery correlates with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival and clarify the characteristics of patients who benefit from it.This retrospective study included 626 operable breast cancer patients. Tumor characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between patients who received radiotherapy and those who did not. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to analyze prognostic factors for DFS and perform subgroup analysis. Propensity score matching was used to evaluate the efficacy of radiotherapy using a logistic regression model in patients who received radiotherapy or did not. The median follow-up duration after diagnosis of breast cancer was 63&#160;months. DFS and overall survival were better in the irradiated group (P=&#160;.002 and P&#160;=&#160;.001, respectively). Radiotherapy was more effective for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease and for early breast cancer without lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that radiotherapy was a dependent risk factor for recurrence or metastasis.Radiotherapy prevents distant metastasis and recurrence in early breast cancer patients. In particular, ER-positive, node-negative patients benefit from Japanese standard tangent field radiation.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Those who had pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC could have long-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).To identify the treatment and patient factors which could predict a pCR to NAC and the associated PFS and OS in a single institute.We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who had received NAC with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) in our centre from January 2004 to December 2017. The patients' age, tumour stage, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), chemotherapy chart, and pathological information were recorded. There were 25 men and five women who had received NAC followed by RC. pCR was noted in the surgical specimen of 11 (37%) patients. The mean dose of gemcitabine was significantly higher in the pCR group than the non-pCR group (9850 vs 7852&#160;mg, P&#160;=&#160;0.039) as was the dose-intensity of cisplatin (87.4% vs 71.3%, P&#160;=&#160;0.044). After a median follow-up of 38&#160;months (range 4.3-154), seven patients had disease progression. The estimated 3-year PFS is 74.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.7%-83.3%). None of the patients who achieved pCR relapsed, while six out of seven patients who had pN1 disease developed distant metastasis (DM). Only two patients died of DM while two other patients died of unrelated causes. The estimated 3-year OS is 88.9% (95% CI 82.8%-95%).We have demonstrated that the dose intensity of GC is a major determinant of pCR, which predicts longer RFS and OS.

A total of 259 consecutive patients were enrolled, receiving 42 to 44&#160;Gy (RLD, n&#160;=&#160;31), 46&#160;Gy (SD1, n&#160;=&#160;69), or 50&#160;Gy (SD2, n&#160;=&#160;159) of CRT, combined with either capecitabine/oxaliplatin or capecitabine only or mFOLFOX6, followed by total mesorectal excision. A 1:4 propensity score matching was employed, and all patients in the RLD group were matched with 124 patients in the SD2 group. Rates of pCR, 3-year local/regional recurrence (LRR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in the RLD group were all not significantly different (0.313 for pCR; 0.884 for LRR; and 0.762 for OS; 0.101 for DFS) from those in SD1 and SD2 groups. The RLD group showed a lower incidence of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity than SD2 group (0.019). A propensity score analysis demonstrated no significant differences in the pCR rates and 3-year outcomes between the RLD and SD2 group.Relatively low-dose regimen (&#8804;44&#160;Gy) of neoadjuvant CRT combined with standard concurrent chemotherapy appears to be both safe and effective in Chinese patients with LARC.

Despite these clinical data, it remains unclear exactly how regorafenib exerts its clinical activity. Preclinical data have attributed multiple mechanisms of action to regorafenib; however, which of these are important to the clinical effects of regorafenib remains unclear. This insight into the multiple mechanisms of action of regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer has provided the basis for new clinical trials investigating novel combinations of this therapy.",

        "abstract": "Anti-cancer activity of tolfenamic acid (TA) in preclinical models for pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is well established. Since the dosage for anti-cancer actions of TA is rather high, we recently demonstrated that IC50 values of Copper-TA are 30-80% less than TA in 12 cancer cell lines. This study elucidates the underlying mechanisms of Copper-TA in PaCa cells. Control and Copper-TA (IC50) treated PaCa cells were processed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to determine differentially expressed genes using HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker panel. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA&#174;) was used to identify functional significance of altered genes. The conformational studies for assessing the expression of key regulators and genes were conducted by Western blot and qPCR. IPA&#174; identified several networks, regulators, as well as molecular and cellular functions associated with cancer. The top 5 molecular and cellular functions affected by Cu-TA treatment were cell death and survival, cellular development, cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle and cellular movement. The expression of top upstream regulators was confirmed by Western blot analysis while qPCR results of selected genes demonstrated that Copper-TA is efficacious at lower doses than TA. Results suggest that Copper-TA alters genes/key regulators associated with cancer and potentially serve as an effective anti-cancer agent.",

It plays multiple protective roles against large group of microorganisms and performs anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. The concentration of serum LF in gilt (primiparous sow) and their piglets remains unknown. We determined serum LF concentration in gilts during gestation and lactation to that of 19-d-old piglets, including sow-fed and formula-fed piglets using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the concentration of serum LF in gilts varied during gestation (0.77 &#177; 0.10 &#181;g/mL) and lactation (0.62 &#177; 0.11 &#181;g/mL). The mean concentration of serum LF in gilts (0.72 &#177; 0.06 &#181;g/mL) was significantly higher than that of piglets (0.42 &#177; 0.07 &#181;g/mL, P = 0.004). Additionally, a marginal significant difference (P =0.06) was observed for serum LF concentration in sow-fed piglets (0.42 &#177; 0.03 &#181;g/mL) at 19 d old compared to that of formula-fed piglets (0.33 &#177; 0.04 &#181;g/mL) at 37 d old. This study provides noble information regarding the serum LF concentration in the healthy gilts and piglets and thereby the data can be used as a standard reference point for future studies on the role of LF in pig reproduction.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Understanding the chemical risk to environment and human health is an important issue when a waste management strategy and a control risk system is analyzed and selected. This is even more important at the end-of-life (recycling, recovery and disposal) scenario for a chemical due to the uncertainty in respect of the most susceptible receptors (e.g., workers), pathways (e.g., groundwater), routes (e.g., inhalation) and hazard (e.g., cancer) associated to a chemical exposure. Hence, selecting a group of sustainability performance indicators for estimating the chemical risk when evaluating end-of-life scenarios is a crucial task. Therefore, this manuscript focuses on a critical analysis of the sustainability indicators taxonomy which are used to assess chemical risk to the environment and human health during end-of-life scenarios. The insights from performing an extensive literature search in the largest database of peer-reviewed literature provide that chemical intake, hazard quotient, hazard index, and carcinogenic risk have been the most commonly used for human health chemical risk. In addition, previous research has been less focused on environment chemical risk, with ecological risk index being the most widely used indicator for. The most employed human health chemical risk sustainability indicators are part of a methodology suggested by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for chemical risk assessment.",

A 72-year-old male presented with a new diagnosis of multiple intraventricular lesions, an anterior mediastinal mass and a rectal mass. His workup revealed rectal adenocarcinoma with intraventricular metastases and an incidental thymoma. Ommaya reservoir placement was performed via an awake procedure rather than under general anesthesia due to airway concerns. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was positive for malignancy and consistent with adenocarcinoma. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient underwent whole brain radiation. Although rare, this diagnosis should always be considered in the differential for solitary or multiple intraventricular lesions. CSF sampling is a useful alternative to intraventricular biopsy for diagnosis of intraventricular metastases. Awake placement of Ommaya reservoir is a safe option in the management of patients with intraventricular metastases, especially those who cannot undergo general anesthesia.",

        "abstract": "Currently, 18F-FDG coincidence SPECT (Co-SPECT)/CT scan still serves as an important tool for diagnosis, staging, and evaluation of cancer treatment in developing countries. We implemented full physical corrections (FPC) to Co-SPECT (quantitative Co-SPECT) to improve the image resolution and contrast along with the capability for image quantitation. FPC included attenuation, scatter, resolution recovery, and noise reduction. A standard NEMA phantom filled with 10:1 F-18 activity concentration ratio in spheres and background was utilized to evaluate image performance. Subsequently, 15 patients with histologically confirmed thoracic carcinomas were included to undergo a 18F-FDG Co-SPECT/CT scan followed by a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Functional parameters as SUVmax, SUVmean, SULpeak, and MTV from both quantitative Co-SPECT and PET were analyzed. Image resolution of Co-SPECT for NEMA phantom was improved to reveal the smallest sphere from a diameter of 28 mm to 22 mm (17 mm for PET). The image contrast was enhanced from 1.7 to 6.32 (6.69 for PET) with slightly degraded uniformity in background (3.1% vs. 6.7%) (5.6% for PET). Patients' SUVmax, SUVmean, SULpeak, and MTV measured from quantitative Co-SPECT were overall highly correlated with those from PET ( r=0.82-0.88). Adjustment of the threshold of SUVmax and SUV to determine SUVmean and MTV did not further change the correlations with PET ( r=0.81-0.88). Adding full physical corrections to Co-SPECT images can significantly improve image resolution and contrast to reveal smaller tumor lesions along with the capability to quantify functional parameters like PET/CT.",

        "abstract": "There is limited understanding concerning the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Due to an overlap of symptoms, it can be difficult to separate disease versus treatment-related effects. Study objectives were to understand the impact of factors that might influence patients' HRQoL, assess the degree of concordance in symptom reporting by patients and physicians, and assess the impact of any discordance on HRQoL in AML patients.Physicians in the USA captured demographics, current AML treatment and symptoms for 82 AML patients who completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu), 5-Dimension EuroQol Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) and Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ). Effect size (ES) and clinically meaningful differences between AML subgroups were assessed, as was the impact of disagreement between patients and physicians regarding symptom recognition.Clinically meaningful lower overall FACT-Leu scores were observed for: relapsed/refractory versus non-relapsed/refractory AML patients (92.5 vs. 103.7; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.09; ES&#8201;=&#8201;0.439), hypomethylating agent (HMA) monotherapy versus other therapies in patients with low treatment intensity (89.9 vs. 112.9; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.0021; ES&#8201;=&#8201;0.971) and presence/absence of FLT3-ITD mutation (85.5 vs. 100; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.148; ES&#8201;=&#8201;0.816). Differences in health state were also clinically meaningful between patients with/without FLT3-ITD; EQ-5D-Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (47.6 vs. 63.7; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.0428; ES&#8201;=&#8201;0.816).

FACT-Leu was associated with patient-physician discordance on bleeding (difference -&#8201;14.12; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.046), weight loss (-&#8201;21.22; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.001) and appetite loss (-&#8201;12.58; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.027).HRQoL is generally low for AML patients, especially for particular subgroups. Discordance in symptom reporting between patients and physicians was common and associated with further negative impacts on HRQoL. There may be many reasons for this but better communication between physicians and patients may lead to shared objectives and improvement in patients' HRQoL.Astellas Pharma, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is cytogenetically characterized by a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#945;) genes. Because patients with APL present a tendency for severe bleeding, often resulting in an early fatal course, APL was historically considered to be one of the most fatal forms of acute leukemia. However, therapeutic advances, including anthracycline- and cytarabine-based chemotherapy, have significantly improved the outcomes of APL patients. Due to the further introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and-more recently-the development of arsenic trioxide (ATO)-containing regimens, APL is currently the most curable form of AML in adults. Treatment with these new agents has introduced the concept of cure through targeted therapy. With the advent of revolutionary ATRA-ATO combination therapies, chemotherapy can now be safely omitted from the treatment of low-risk APL patients. In this article, we review the six-decade history of APL, from its initial characterization to the era of chemotherapy-free ATRA-ATO, a model of cancer-targeted therapy.",

Advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics have enabled genomic research to evolve from the evaluation of alterations at the single-gene level to studies on the whole-genome scale using large-scale genotyping and next generation sequencing techniques. International collaborative efforts have resulted in the construction of databases to curate the identified genetic alterations that are clinically significant, and these are currently utilized in clinical sequencing and liquid biopsy screening/monitoring. Furthermore, countless clinical studies have accumulated sufficient evidence to match cancer patients to therapies by utilizing the information of clinical-relevant alterations. In this review we summarize the importance of germline alterations that act as predictive biomarkers for drug-induced toxicity and drug response as well as somatic mutations in cancer cells that function as drug targets.

Although tissue biopsy is the gold standard for determining molecular alterations in tumors, its limitations have prompted the development of new techniques for studying tumor biomarkers in liquid biopsies, such as mutation analysis in cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA analysis can accurately determine tumor progression and prognosis and more effectively identify appropriate targeted therapies. However, cfDNA is vulnerable, particularly during plasma sample shipping.We compared the cell- and DNA-stabilizing properties of cell-free DNA blood collection tubes (BCTs) with those of the traditional shipping method (frozen plasma) for EGFR mutation testing using the cobas&#174; EGFR Mutation Test v2 in a prospective cohort of 49 patients from three different Spanish hospitals.In total, 98 NSCLC samples, two from each patient, were studied; five of the 49 cases were considered invalid by cobas&#174; with one of the two shipping methods analyzed. After excluding these samples, we analyzed 88 samples from 44 patients. Considering the current methodology (frozen plasma) for sending samples as the gold standard, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA BCT shipment.The global agreement between the two methods was 95.4%, with 100% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity for the cfDNA BCTs. cfDNA BCTs had a positive predictive value of 81.8% and negative predictive value of 100%.cfDNA BCTs have the same sensitivity for EGFR mutation analysis in liquid biopsy as the current methodology and very high specificity. They also have some additional advantages in terms of collection and further shipment. Therefore, cfDNA BCTs can be perfectly incorporated into the routine practice for EGFR mutation determination.Roche Farma S.A., Spain.",

Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and autophagy modulation have been proposed as mediators of DOX cardiotoxicity.After baseline echocardiography, adult male CD1 mice were randomized to either sham or RIPC protocol (3 cycles of 5 min femoral artery occlusion followed by 5 min reperfusion) 1 h before receiving DOX (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The mice were observed primarily for survival over 85 days (86 mice). An additional cohort of 50 mice was randomized to either sham or RIPC 1 h before DOX treatment and was followed for 25 days, at which time cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were assessed, as well as the expression profiles of apoptosis and autophagy markers.Survival was significantly improved in the RIPC cohort compared with the sham cohort (p = 0.007). DOX-induced cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis were significantly attenuated with RIPC compared with sham (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). Although no mitochondrial dysfunction was detected at 25 days, there was a significant increase in autophagy markers with DOX that was attenuated with RIPC. Moreover, DOX caused a 49% decline in cardiac BCL2/BAX expression, which was restored with RIPC (p < 0.05 vs. DOX). DOX also resulted in a 17% reduction in left ventricular mass at 25 days, which was prevented with RIPC (p < 0.01), despite the lack of significant changes in left ventricular ejection fraction.Our preclinical results suggested that RIPC before DOX administration might be a promising approach for attenuating DOX cardiotoxicity.",

Caenorhabditis elegans is commonly used as a model host in the study of interactions with microbial pathogens and releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a component of its defense response. We adapted the Amplex&#174; Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit to measure H2O2 output from live Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to microbial pathogens. The assay differs from other forms of ROS detection in the worm, like dihydrofluorescein dyes and genetically encoded probes such as HyPer, in that it generally detects released, extracellular ROS rather than intracellular ROS, though the distinction between the two is blurred by the fact that certain species of ROS, including H2O2, can cross membranes. The protocol involves feeding C. elegans on a lawn of the pathogen of interest for a period of time. The animals are then rinsed off the plates in buffer and washed to remove any microbes on their cuticle. Finally, the animals in buffer are distributed into 96-well plates and Amplex&#174; Red and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) are added. Any H2O2 released into the buffer by the worms will react with the Amplex&#174; Red reagent in a 1:1 ratio in the presence of HRP to produce the red fluorescent excitation product resorufin that can be measured fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically, and the amount of H2O2 released can be calculated by comparison to a standard curve. The assay is most appropriate for studies focused on released ROS, and its advantages include ease of use, the ability to use small numbers of animals in a plate reader assay in which measurements can be taken either fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically.",

The SCN-driven body temperature (BT) oscillation induces rhythmic expression of HSP70, which promotes SIRT7 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Acute temperature challenge dampens the BT oscillation and causes an advanced liver circadian phase. Further, hepatic SIRT7 deacetylates CRY1, promotes its FBXL3-mediated degradation and regulates the hepatic clock and glucose homeostasis. Loss of Sirt7 in mice leads to an advanced liver circadian phase and rapid entrainment of the hepatic clock upon daytime-restricted feeding. These data identify a BT-HSP70-SIRT7-CRY1 axis that couples the mouse hepatic clock to the central pacemaker and ensures circadian phase coherence and glucose homeostasis.",

Dysregulation of FGF15/19 signalling may contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases affecting the gut-liver axis and to metabolic diseases.

We also discuss the putative therapeutic potential in areas of unmet medical need-such has cholestatic liver diseases and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, for which FGF19 is being tested in ongoing clinical trials-as well as the possibility of using FGF19 for the treatment of obesity and type II diabetes.",

RANKL is synthesized as a membrane-bound molecule, and cleaved into its soluble form by proteases5-7. As the soluble form of RANKL does not contribute greatly to bone remodelling or ovariectomy-induced bone loss8, whether soluble RANKL has a role in pathological settings remains unclear. Here we show that soluble RANKL promotes the formation of tumour metastases in bone. Mice that selectively lack soluble RANKL (Tnfsf11&#916;S/&#916;S)5-7,9 have normal bone homoeostasis and develop a normal immune system but display markedly reduced numbers of bone metastases after intracardiac injection of RANK-expressing melanoma and breast cancer cells. Deletion of soluble RANKL does not affect osteoclast numbers in metastatic lesions or tumour metastasis to non-skeletal tissues. Therefore, soluble RANKL is dispensable for physiological regulation of bone and immune systems, but has a distinct and pivotal role in the promotion of bone metastases.",

        "abstract": "Metformin is the most commonly prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes, owing to its glucose-lowering effects, which are mediated through the suppression of hepatic glucose production (reviewed in refs. 1-3). However, in addition to its effects on the liver, metformin reduces appetite and in preclinical models exerts beneficial effects on ageing and a number of diverse diseases (for example, cognitive disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease) through mechanisms that are not fully understood1-3. Given the high concentration of metformin in the liver and its many beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, we reasoned that metformin may increase the secretion of a hepatocyte-derived endocrine factor that communicates with the central nervous system4. Here we show, using unbiased transcriptomics of mouse hepatocytes and analysis of proteins in human serum, that metformin induces expression and secretion of growth differentiating factor 15 (GDF15). In primary mouse hepatocytes, metformin stimulates the secretion of GDF15 by increasing the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP; also known as DDIT3). In wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet, oral administration of metformin increases serum GDF15 and reduces food intake, body mass, fasting insulin and glucose intolerance; these effects are eliminated in GDF15 null mice. An increase in serum GDF15 is also associated with weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes who take metformin. Although further studies will be required to determine the tissue source(s) of GDF15 produced in response to metformin in vivo, our data indicate that the therapeutic benefits of metformin on appetite, body mass and serum insulin depend on GDF15.",

In the present study, it is reported that LEC-specific loss of OXCT1, a key enzyme of ketone body oxidation2, reduces LEC proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting in vitro and impairs lymphangiogenesis in development and disease in Prox1&#916;OXCT1 mice. Mechanistically, OXCT1 silencing lowers acetyl-CoA levels, tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite pools, and nucleotide precursor and deoxynucleotide triphosphate levels required for LEC proliferation. Ketone body supplementation to LECs induces the opposite effects. Notably, elevation of lymph ketone body levels by a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet or by administration of the ketone body &#946;-hydroxybutyrate increases lymphangiogenesis after corneal injury and myocardial infarction. Intriguingly, in a mouse model of microsurgical ablation of LVs in the tail, which repeats features of acquired lymphoedema in humans, the ketogenic diet improves LV function and growth, reduces infiltration of anti-lymphangiogenic immune cells and decreases oedema, suggesting a novel dietary therapeutic opportunity.",

While the photoluminescence response to gate voltage depends on the redox potential of the nanotube, analogous optical voltammetry of functionalized carbon nanotubes could be conducted in suspension without applying voltage but by varying the solution conditions as well as the chemistry of the encapsulating polymer. Steady-state photoluminescence, absorbance, and in situ measurements of O2/H2O reactivity show correlation with the pH/pK a-dependent reactivity of &#960;-rich coatings.

However, the biological mechanisms underlying the role of specific O-GlcNAc sites and their link to phenotypes remain largely unexplored due to lack of suitable in vivo models. TGF-&#946; activated kinase-1 binding protein-1 (TAB1) is a scaffolding protein required for TGF-&#946; activated kinase-1 (TAK1) mediated signalling. A single O-GlcNAc site has been identified on human TAB1 that modulates TAK1-mediated cytokine release in cells. Methods: Here, we report the generation of the Tab1 S393A  mouse model using a constitutive knock-in strategy. The Tab1 S393A  mice carry a Ser393Ala (S393A) mutation that leads to loss of O-GlcNAcylation site on TAB1. Results: We did not observe any obvious phenotype in Tab1 S393A mice. Loss of O-GlcNAcylation on TAB1 has no consequences on TAB1 protein level or on TAB1-TAK1 interaction. Conclusions: The homozygous Tab1 S393A  mice are viable and develop with no obvious abnormalities, providing a powerful tool to further investigate the role of O-GlcNAc on TAB1 in the inflammatory response in the context of a whole organism.Copyright: &#169; 2020 Authier F et al.",

Analyses describe the prevalence and predictors of financial distress among cancer survivors. Subsequent analyses were conducted with Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) data to compare local versus national estimates of financial distress. Almost two-thirds of Appalachian survivors reported financial distress compared to one-third of the HINTS sample. Appalachian survivors residing in the most rural counties reported higher distress; this finding was not supported in the national sample. In multivariable analyses, gender, current age, and household income were associated with financial distress among Appalachians; only income was significant among the national sample.Appalachian cancer survivors have higher than national estimates of financial distress; rurality and socioeconomics are drivers of this disparity.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Research has found that resilience has a role in adolescents' adaptation to maternal cancer; however, the nature of this requires further exploration.This analysis will help understand resilience in adolescents that experience maternal cancer by exploring the nature of resilience and the individual, family, and environmental risk and protective factors that determine resilience in adolescent lived experiences of maternal cancer that enable positive outcomes.This study is part of a larger investigation focused on understanding adolescent adjustment to maternal cancer and the psychosocial factors that promote adjustment. Original adolescent interview transcripts (n&#160;=&#160;15) were subject to a secondary thematic analysis.The analysis yielded four themes: the first theme, The Journey of Maternal Cancer, describes adolescent experiences of maternal cancer over time; the second theme is a detailed description of adolescent Protective Factors and how these supported the adolescents; the third theme describes the Risk Factors that adolescents faced; and the fourth theme summarizes the Positive Outcomes that adolescents self-identified.This study found resilience as dynamic, as it changes over time. These changes are a result of the course of maternal illness and its treatment over time. Adolescents can adapt to change, but this capacity is shaped by protective factors and risk factors as well as challenges that are unique to having a mother diagnosed with cancer. Most adolescents managed to navigate successfully and identified positive outcomes from a difficult and life-changing experience. The study suggests the need to provide long-term supports for adolescents and carry out longitudinal research to further understand the trajectories of resilience in adolescents who experience maternal cancer.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Unlike in vivo settings, in vitro experiments allow a fine-tuned control of a range of microenvironmental elements independently within an isolated setting. The recent expansion in the use of three-dimensional (3D) in vitro assays has created a number of representative tools to study cell behaviour in a more physiologically 3D relevant microenvironment. Complex 3D in vitro models that can recapitulate human tissue biology are essential for understanding the pathophysiology of disease.The development of the 3D coculture collagen contraction and invasion assay, the \"organotypic assay,\" has been widely adopted as a powerful approach to bridge the gap between standard two-dimensional tissue culture and in vivo mouse models. In the cancer setting, these assays can then be used to dissect how stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), drive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling to alter cancer cell behaviour and response to intervention. However, to date, many of the published organotypic protocols are low-throughput, time-consuming (up to several weeks), and work-intensive with often limited scalability. Our aim was to develop a fast, high-throughput, scalable 3D organotypic assay for use in oncology screening and drug development.Here, we describe a modified 96-well organotypic assay, the \"Mini-Organo,\" which can be easily completed within 5&#160;days. We demonstrate its application in a wide range of mouse and human cancer biology approaches including evaluation of stromal cell 3D ECM remodelling, 3D cancer cell invasion, and the assessment of efficacy of potential anticancer therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the organotypic assay described is highly amenable to customisation using different cell types under diverse experimental conditions.The Mini-Organo high-throughput 3D organotypic assay allows the rapid screening of potential cancer therapeutics in human and mouse models in a time-efficient manner.&#169; 2019 The Authors Cancer Reports Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Additionally, several well-characterized studies have shown that small GTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are induced in vitro under hypoxia, but whether and how hypoxia regulates RhoB in breast cancer remains elusive.To determine whether and how hypoxia regulates RhoB expression and to understand the role of RhoB in breast cancer metastasis.We investigated the effects of hypoxia on the expression and activation of RhoB using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. We also examined the significance of both decreased and increased RhoB expression in breast cancer using CRISPR depletion of RhoB or a vector overexpressing RhoB in 3D in vitro migration models and in an in vivo mouse model.We found that hypoxia significantly upregulated RhoB mRNA and protein expression resulting in increased levels of activated RhoB. Both loss of RhoB and gain of RhoB expression led to reduced migration in a 3D collagen matrix and invasion within a multicellular 3D spheroid. We showed that neither the reduction nor overexpression of RhoB affected tumor growth in vivo. While the loss of RhoB had no effect on metastasis, RhoB overexpression led to decreased metastasis to the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes of mice.Our results suggest that RhoB may have an important role in suppressing breast cancer metastasis.&#169; 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "To determine the impact of transitioning from guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) on the detection rate of adenomas, advanced adenomas (AA) and colorectal cancer (CRC).Recently, the health region in Edmonton, Alberta switched from gFOBT to FIT for CRC screening.A retrospective analysis of all patients, aged 50 to 74 years, referred for colonoscopy from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 due to a positive gFOBT (at least one of three samples positively using the guaiac-based Hemoccult II SENSA in 2013) or FIT (&#8805;75 &#181;g/g of stool, using the Polymedco OC FIT-CHEK in 2014). The primary outcomes were the number of colon cancers, AA and adenomas detected in 2013 and 2014. A comparison between the two tests was also made for the composite outcome of detection of either AA or CRC.Six hundred and forty-nine patients underwent colonoscopy due to a positive gFOBT in 2013, and 2167 patients for a positive FIT in 2014. FIT compared with gFOBT detected more CRC (67 compared with 34), AA (770 compared with 147) and adenomas (1575 versus 320). By multivariable regression analysis adjusted for different demographics and endoscopic metrics, positive FIT was independently associated with higher adenoma detection rate (odds ratio [OR] 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.13 to 3.21, P < 0.001), AA detection rate (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.33, P < 0.001), and the composite outcome of AA and CRC (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.59, P < 0.001).Adoption of FIT compared with gFOBT led to higher detection of colon cancer, AA and adenomas.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

Priming can influence behaviors in a predictable manner. We aimed to use the Future Thinking Priming task, administered remotely, to reliably decrease delay discounting rates.In this pre-post randomized control group design, participants completed multiple delay discounting measures at baseline; then, 2 weeks later, they were randomized to Future Thinking Priming or Neutral Priming conditions. We hypothesized that Future Thinking Priming would significantly decrease delay discounting rates accounting for baseline delay discounting rates and time in repeated measures analyses.Participants randomized to Future Thinking Priming (N = 783) demonstrated significantly lower delay discounting rates post-intervention than those randomized to Neutral Priming (N = 747) on multiple delay discounting measures and magnitudes.A single administration of Future Thinking Priming produces statistically reliable reductions in delay discounting rates. The task is brief, can be administered remotely, and is highly scalable. If found to support behavior change, the task might be disseminated broadly to enhance evidence-based behavior change interventions. Future research must determine optimal exposure patterns to support durable health behavior change.",

Height and weight were measured to calculate BMI. All were genotyped for the SNPs rs9939609 and rs17782313 using a Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method. For statistical analysis, the chi-square test and SPSS software were used.In subgroup analyses defined by BMI, FTO rs9939609 genotypes (TT/AA/AT) were significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer only in non-obese subjects (p < 0.005). TT genotypes of MC4R rs17782313 in non-obese and genotypes TT/CC in the overweight group were also statistically associated with breast cancer (p &lt; 0.005). No significant associations between any variants and breast cancer risk were seen in obese subjects.Based on the absence of an association between obesity-related SNPs and breast cancer in obese subjects, it is proposed that weight gain in Iranian women will help prevent breast cancer risk.

Two cost-cutting techniques are combined to efficiently execute SA: use of distributed hybrid systems for parallel execution and computation reuse at multiple levels of an analysis pipeline to reduce the amount of computation. These techniques were evaluated using a cancer image analysis workflow on a hybrid cluster with 256 nodes, each with an Intel Phi and a dual socket CPU. Our parallel execution method attained an efficiency of over 90% on 256 nodes. The hybrid execution on the CPU and Intel Phi improved the performance by 2&#215;.

Among these patients, 98 were classified as Siewert type 2 AEG. The patients underwent intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy through either a transorally inserted-anvil method (n&#8201;=&#8201;27) or extracorporeal anastomosis usinga circular stapler (n&#8201;=&#8201;71). After generating propensity scores with covariates that were associated with developing anastomotic leakage, 26 patients who underwent esophagojejunostomy via the transorally inserted-anvil method (transoral group) were 1:1 matched with 26 patients who underwent the procedure via extracorporeal anastomosis using a circular stapler (extracorporeal group). The safety after 30&#8201;days post-operatively was compared between the two groups.The transoral group and extracorporeal group were balanced regarding the baseline variables. The operative time, reconstruction duration, number of dissected lymph nodes, length of the proximal resection margins, estimated blood loss, intra-operative complication rate, and post-operative recovery course were not significantly different between the two groups.

Using a custom built FLIm instrument integrated with the da Vinci robotic surgical platform, we first demonstrate that cancer in epithelial tissue diagnosed by histopathology can be differentiated from surrounding healthy epithelial tissue imaged in vivo prior to cancer resection and ex vivo on the excised specimen. Second, we study the fluorescence properties of tissue imaged in vivo at surgical resection margins (tumor bed). Fluorescence lifetimes and spectral intensity ratios were calculated for three spectral channels, producing a set of six FLIm parameters. Current results from 10 patients undergoing TORS procedures demonstrate that healthy epithelium can be resolved from cancer (P < .001) for at least one FLIm parameter. We also showed that a multiparameter linear discriminant analysis approach provides superior discrimination to individual FLIm parameters for tissue imaged both in vivo and ex vivo. Overall, this study highlights the potential for FLIm to be developed into a diagnostic tool for clinical cancer applications of the oropharynx. This technique could help to circumvent the issues posed by the lack of tactile feedback associated with robotic surgical platforms to better enable cancer delineation.",

However, due to drug resistance in PDAC patients, this treatment has become less effective. Over the years, clinical trials for the quest of finding novel compounds that can be used in combination with gemcitabine have met very little success.To predict the driving factors behind pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and to understand the effect of these components in the progression of the disease and their contribution to cell growth and proliferation.With the help of systems biology approaches and using gene expression data, which is generally found in abundance, dysregulated elements in key signalling pathways were predicted. Prominent dysregulated elements were integrated into a model to simulate and study the effect of gemcitabine-induced hypoxia.In this study, several transcription factors in the form of key drivers of cancer-related genes were predicted with the help of CARNIVAL, and the effect of gemcitabine-induced hypoxia on the apoptosis pathway was shown to have an effect on the downstream elements of two primary pathway models; EGF/VEGF and TNF signalling pathway.It was observed that EGF/VEGF signalling pathway played a major role in inducing drug resistance through cell growth, proliferation, and avoiding cell death.

We aimed to assess the independent role of T2DM on HCC risk among patients with different liver disease etiologies.We analyzed the United Network for Organ Sharing database of all adults registered for liver transplantation (LT) between February 27, 2002 and December 31, 2017. For initial analyses, patients were divided into four groups: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and all other etiologies with or without T2DM. For additional analyses, we divided them based on underlying etiology. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of T2DM with NASH and other etiologies on HCC risk.Overall, 24,149 (21.6%) of the listed patients had HCC. Of those, 23.9% had T2DM. When compared with nondiabetics, patient with NASH and T2DM had the highest risk of HCC (odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-1.86), followed by patients with other etiologies and diabetes. After adjusting for other risk factors, these associations remained unchanged. Registrants with T2DM and NASH, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and alcoholic liver disease were at higher risk of HCC than those without diabetes, but in patients with chronic hepatitis B or primary biliary cholangitis, diabetes did not increase the HCC risk. Between 2004 and 2016, the annual percentage change of HCC incidence increased for all patients with NASH and hepatitis C regardless of their diabetes status. For those with hepatitis B, this trend was significant only for diabetics.The additive risk of T2DM for HCC development was highest in patients with NASH. HCC risk may vary depending on the underlying etiology.&#169; 2019 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Suspension spheroid cultures of anchorage-dependent cell types have been widely used in cancer and stem cell research, as well as for producing organoids. It is believed that the 3-dimensional spheroid presents cells with a more physiological microenvironment to grow so that they behave more like cells in vivo, which is lacking in conventional 2-dimensional monolayer cultures. Recently, it has been reported that cancer cells grown as spheroids could express stem cell-associated genes. Hence, it is investigated whether normal mouse and human fibroblasts cultured as spheroids could also be induced to express stem cell-associated genes. The transcriptomes of human fibroblasts cultured as a monolayer and spheroids are compared and analyzed using real-time RT-qPCR, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatics. The results reveal that the spheroid transcriptome resemble somatic cells being reprogramed into stem cells, including the induced expression of stemness-associated genes, increased expression of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition-associated genes, and decreased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated genes. In this context, it is hypothesized that during the process of spheroid formation, matrix-cell signaling is lost in favor of cell-cell contact signaling and that this subsequently increases the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway that then upregulates Tbdx3 and stemness-associated genes.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "Cell-cell cross talk is of great importance in cancer research due to its major role in proliferation, differentiation, migration, and influence on the apoptotic pathway. Different cell-cell communication mechanisms have come mainly from proteomic and genomic approaches. In this paper, a new route is reported for cross talk between cancer cells that occurs, even when they are far away from each other. Single-cell and culture analysis shows that upregulation of cancer cells emits hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into their headspace. Part of the VOCs remains without any change, disregarding the biological environment around it. The other part of the VOCs is exchanged between monocultures of the cells as well as between co-cultures of the cells with no physical contact between them, leading to different changes in growth than when left on their own. The chemical nature and composition of these VOCs have been determined and are discussed herein. Cell-to-cell cross talk has the advantage of being suitable for transfer/diffusion over relatively long distances. It would thus be expected to serve as a shuttling pad toward the development of advanced approaches that could enable very early detection of cancer and/or monitoring of metastasis and related cancer therapy.&#169; 2020 The Authors published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Hyaluronan (HA) is one of the main components of the extracellular environment and has been shown to play an important role in different cancers and their progression. However, current methods of HA immobilization often require its chemical modification. Herein, a peptide-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is used as an anchor to immobilize unmodified HA on a bare gold surface, as demonstrated by the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. Peptide-HA surfaces show increased roughness and greater hydrophobicity when compared to poly-D-lysine/HA surfaces, as measured by atomic force microscopy and water contact angle, respectively. Additionally, the peptide SAM can be micro-contact printed and used to restrict the presentation of HA to specific regions, thereby creating HA patterned surfaces to examine cell behavior. When used for cell culture, these surfaces result in altered adhesion and migration of LUC4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells. These biomimetic surfaces can provide insights into the role of HA in cancer and other diseases and be used as a platform for the development of cell sorting devices.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With the advances in super-resolution microscopy, fluorescence labeling, and nanoscale biosensing, new information may be obtained for the design of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. The discovery of cellular heterogeneity further stresses the importance of single-cell analysis to improve our understanding of disease mechanism and to develop new strategies for disease treatment. To this end, many studies are exploited at the single-cell level for high throughput, highly parallel, and quantitative analysis. Technically, microfluidics are also designed to facilitate single-cell isolation and enrichment for downstream detection and manipulation in a robust, sensitive, and automated manner. Further achievements are made possible by consolidating optically label-free, electrical, and molecular sensing techniques. Moreover, these technologies are coupled with computing algorithms for high throughput and automated quantitative analysis with a short turnaround time. To reflect on how the technological developments have advanced single-cell analysis, this mini-review is aimed to offer readers an introduction to single-cell analysis with a brief historical development and the recent progresses that have enabled multiscale analysis of single-cells in the last decade. The challenges and future trends are also discussed with the view to inspire forthcoming technical developments.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. Matching proper treatment and dosage is crucial for a positive outcome. Any given drug may affect patients with similar tumors differently. Personalized medicine aims to address this issue. Unfortunately, most cancer samples cannot be expanded in culture, limiting conventional cell-based testing. Herein, presented is a microfluidic device that combines a drug microarray with cell microscopy. The device can perform 512 experiments to test chemosensitivity and resistance to a drug array. MCF7 and 293T cells are cultured inside the device and their chemosensitivity and resistance to docetaxel, applied at various concentrations, are determined. Cell mortality is determined as a function of drug concentration and exposure time. It is found that both cell types form cluster morphology within the device, not evident in conventional tissue culture under similar conditions. Cells inside the clusters are less sensitive to drugs than dispersed cells. These findings support a heterogenous response of cancer cells to drugs. Then demonstrated is the principle of drug microarrays by testing cell response to four different drugs at four different concentrations. This approach may enable the personalization of treatment to the particular tumor and patient and may eventually improve final patient outcome.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

As a popular amyloid specific dye, ThT is nonfluorescent by itself, while its fluorescence can be lighted up upon interacting with amyloid proteins. Herein, ThT is coassembled with the BSA scaffold at high temperature to form T(hT)-FPNs. These green fluorescence emissive bio-abiotic hybrid materials can serve as a novel probe for real-time nucleolus imaging of living cells.

        "abstract": "Profiling cellular biomarkers without the interference of endogenous signals could facilitate the investigation of complex intracellular biological events and provide new possibilities for precision disease diagnosis. Herein, a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe with a high signal-to-background ratio (SBR) for cellular biomarker imaging is constructed. The probes are prepared by incorporating Prussian blue (PB) with porous gold nanoparticles (p-Au NPs). Due to their rich built-in Raman hotspots, the p-Au NPs are excellent SERS substrates that can significantly amplify the signals of the incorporated PB. In parallel, PB shows a single peak in the cellular silent region, where the signals from the probes and endogenous molecules can be completely resolved without the need of complex spectral unmixing. As a consequence, the combination of probe signal enhancement and background elimination endows the SERS probes with an extremely high SBR. To evaluate their performance in biomarker imaging, the high-SBR SERS probes are utilized to profile folic acids at a single-cell level. This background-free, high-precision imaging technique is conducive to early diagnosis and therapeutic response of cancer that is of great importance in clinical settings.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "RNA biomarkers have been recently reported to be associated tightly with the diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases. Particularly, cancers considered to be a serious threat to primates are known to be vastly dominated by genetic networks where RNA plays a key role. RNAs are thus recognized as a major target group that can be used for numerous cancer treatments and it is still required to identify and enumerate them in an effective manner. Here, a new topological transformation-based nanobarcoding technique (TNT) is first reported using fluorescence-DNA barcodes engaged with graphene oxide (GOx ) for effectively discriminating short RNAs such as miRNAs and their single nucleotide polyporphisms in tissue and plasma. Through topological transformation into 3D DNA-RNA polygonal structures, various kinds of microRNAs have been read at the same time and analyzed quantitatively. Also, it positively discerned epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations known as single base variations of typical lung cancer specific RNAs. A single variant of 0.785% in target EGFR mutations is explicitly detected. It is speculated that the TNT may be a versatile method for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-free practical diagnosis of several clinical genetic deviations such as significant biotic RNA and genic fragments and would be a promising alternative to conventional PCR terrains.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "It is increasingly being accepted that cells' physiological functions are substantially dependent on the mechanical characteristics of their surrounding tissue. This is mainly due to the key role of biomechanical forces on cells and their nucleus' shapes, which have the capacity to regulate chromatin conformation and thus gene regulations. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that altering the biomechanical properties of tissue may have the capacity to change cell functions. Here, the role of cell stretching (as a model of biomechanical variations) is probed in cell migration and invasion capacity using human normal and cancerous breast cells. By several analyses (i.e., scratch assay, invasion to endothelial barrier, real-time RNA sequencing, confocal imaging, patch clamp, etc.), it is revealed that the cell-stretching process could increase the migration and invasion capabilities of normal and cancerous cells, respectively. More specifically, it is found that poststretched breast cancer cells are found in low grades of invasion; they substantially upregulate the expression of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) through activation of H-Ras proteins, which subsequently induce aerobic glycolysis followed by an overproduction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-reinforced filopodias. Presence of such invadopodias facilitates targeting of the endothelial layer, and increased invasive behaviors in breast cells are observed.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment contribute to breast cancer progression. While mechanosensing has been extensively studied using 2D substrates, much less is known about it in a physiologically more relevant 3D context. Here it is demonstrated that breast cancer tumor spheroids, growing in 3D polyethylene glycol-heparin hydrogels, are sensitive to their environment stiffness. During tumor spheroid growth, compressive stresses of up to 2 kPa build up, as quantitated using elastic polymer beads as stress sensors. Atomic force microscopy reveals that tumor spheroid stiffness increases with hydrogel stiffness. Also, constituent cell stiffness increases in a Rho associated kinase (ROCK)- and F-actin-dependent manner. Increased hydrogel stiffness correlated with attenuated tumor spheroid growth, a higher proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Drug-mediated ROCK inhibition not only reverses cell stiffening upon culture in stiff hydrogels but also increases tumor spheroid growth. Taken together, a mechanism by which the growth of a tumor spheroid can be regulated via cytoskeleton rearrangements in response to its mechanoenvironment is revealed here. Thus, the findings contribute to a better understanding of how cancer cells react to compressive stress when growing under confinement in stiff environments.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "Lymph node (LN) metastasis causes poor prognosis for patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Although LN-cells and cellular responses play a pivotal role in cancer metastasis, the interplay between LN-cells and PCa cells is undetermined due to the small size and widespread distribution of LNs. To identify factors responsible for LN metastasis, a 3D cell culture biosystem is fabricated to simulate LN responses during metastasis. First, it is determined that LN explants previously exposed to high metastatic PCa release substantially more chemotactic factors to promote metastatic PCa migration than those exposed to low-metastatic PCa. Furthermore, T-lymphocytes are found to produce chemotactic factors in LNs, among which, CXCL12, CCL21, and IL-10 are identified to have the most chemotactic effect. To mimic the LN microenvironment, Cytodex beads are seeded with T cells to produce a LN-mimetic biosystem in both static and flow conditions. As expected, the flow condition permits prolonged cellular responses. Interestingly, when PCa cells with varying metastatic potentials are introduced into the system, it produces PCa-specific chemokines accordingly. These results support that the LN mimetic helps in analyzing the processes underlying metastasized LNs and for testing various treatments to reduce cancer LN metastasis.&#169; 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "Arginase-1 is a manganese-dependent metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. Arginase-1 is abundantly expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells that promote tumor immunosuppression, which is relieved by inhibition of Arginase-1. We have characterized the potencies of the Arginase-1 reference inhibitors (2S)-2-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH) and N &#969;-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA), and studied their pH-dependence and binding kinetics. To gain a better understanding of the structural changes underlying the high pH optimum of Arginase-1 and its pH-dependent inhibition, we determined the crystal structure of the human Arginase-1/ABH complex at pH 7.0 and 9.0. These structures revealed that at increased pH, the manganese cluster assumes a more symmetrical coordination structure, which presumably contributes to its increase in catalytic activity. Furthermore, we show that binding of ABH involves the presence of a sodium ion close to the manganese cluster. We also studied the investigational new drug CB-1158 (INCB001158). This inhibitor has a low-nanomolar potency at pH 7.4 and increases the thermal stability of Arginase-1 more than ABH and nor-NOHA. Moreover, CB-1158 displays slow association and dissociation kinetics at both pH 9.5 and 7.4, as indicated by surface plasmon resonance. The potent character of CB-1158 is presumably due to its increased rigidity compared to ABH as well as the formation of an additional hydrogen-bond network as observed by resolution of the Arginase-1/CB-1158 crystal structure.&#169; 2019 The Authors.",

Prostate cancer incidence rates tend to be positively associated with socioeconomic status. On the other hand, low socioeconomic status is associated with increased risk of poorer survival. There are well-documented disparities in prostate cancer survival by socioeconomic status, race, education, and census tract-level poverty. The results of this review indicate that social determinants such as poverty, lack of education, immigration status, lack of social support, and social isolation play an important role in prostate cancer stage at diagnosis and survival.

Several decades of research have provided great insight into GBM progression; however, the prognosis remains poor with a median patient survival time of ~ 15 months. The tumour microenvironment (TME) of GBM plays a crucial role in mediating tumour progression and thus is being explored as a therapeutic target. Progress in the development of treatments targeting the TME is currently limited by a lack of model systems that can accurately recreate the distinct extracellular matrix composition and anatomic features of the brain, such as the blood-brain barrier and axonal tracts. Biomaterials can be applied to develop synthetic models of the GBM TME to mimic physiological and pathophysiological features of the brain, including cellular and ECM composition, mechanical properties, and topography. In this Review, we summarize key features of the GBM microenvironment and discuss different strategies for the engineering of GBM TME models, including 2D and 3D models featuring chemical and mechanical gradients, interfaces and fluid flow. Finally, we highlight the potential of engineered TME models as platforms for mechanistic discovery and drug screening as well as preclinical testing and precision medicine.",

The last one decade has seen a phenomenal progress in the therapeutic options available for the management. Although it still remains incurable, with the advent of newer therapies, the median survival in many risk groups is now around 10&#160;years. Conventional karyotyping of bone marrow samples has a positivity rate of 20-30% at diagnosis in patients of Multiple Myeloma. However, array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH) has revealed that almost all MM patients have cytogenetic abnormalities which may affect the pathophysiology, selection of therapy and outcomes of the disease. The progress in the field of exploring the genetic landscape of multiple myeloma with multiple tools like Fluorescent in-situ hybridization, aCGH, Next Generation Sequencing, Flow cytometry, etc., combined with the traditional risk stratification markers like albumin, &#946;2 microglobulin and LDH, is gradually leading towards a risk-adapted therapy. The recent R-ISS risk stratification has combined these two group of information to validate a prognostic score which is an improvement over the past tools like DSS and ISS. In view of the plethora of information available on the multitude of cytogenetic markers there is a tendency to evaluate for all of them at diagnosis, especially in research centers. This leads to a significant increase in the cost of therapy of Multiple Myeloma in day-to-day clinical practice and an increased out-of-pocket spending to the patient, especially in resource-limited settings like India. Also, there is a variable approach to pre-therapy cytogenetic evaluation and risk stratification at different Hematology centres in the country, often dictated by financial constraints and availability of specialized tests.

Second, we discovered TRIM23, a member of the Tripartite Motif family of proteins, as a regulator of MPNST lung metastatic spread in vivo.The ability to track the genomic evolution from primary to metastatic MPNST offers new insights into the sequence of genetic events required for tumor progression and has identified TRIM23 as a novel target for future study in this rare cancer.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are heterogeneous, highly aggressive tumors with no widely effective treatment other than surgery. Genomic architecture of MPNST is similar to other soft tissue sarcomas, with a relatively modest burden of single nucleotide variants and an elevated frequency of copy-number alterations. Recent advances in genomic studies identified previously unrecognized critical involvement of polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) core components SUZ12 and EED in transition to malignancy. Notably, somatic changes in NF1, CDKN2A/B, and PRC2 are found in most MPNST regardless of their etiology (e.g. neurofibromatosis type 1-associated vs. sporadic vs. radiation-induced), indicating that similar molecular mechanisms impact pathogenesis in these neoplasms. The timing and specific order of genetic or epigenetic changes may, however, explain the typically poorer prognosis of NF1-associated MPNSTs. Studies that reveal genes and regulatory pathways uniquely altered in malignancies are essential to development of targeted tumor therapies. Characterization of MPNST molecular profiles may also contribute to tools for earlier detection, and prediction of prognosis or drug response.

        "title": "Diagnosis and management of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: Current practice and future perspectives.",
        "abstract": "One of the most common malignancies affecting adults with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive sarcoma that typically develops from benign plexiform neurofibromas. Approximately 8-13% of individuals with NF1 will develop MPNST during young adulthood. There are few therapeutic options, and the vast majority of people with these cancers will die within 5 years of diagnosis. Despite efforts to understand the pathogenesis of these aggressive tumors, the overall prognosis remains dismal. This manuscript will review the current understanding of the cellular and molecular progression of MPNST, diagnostic workup of patients with these tumors, current treatment paradigms, and investigational treatment options. Additionally, we highlight novel areas of preclinical research, which may lead to future clinical trials. In summary, MPNST remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and future work is needed to develop novel and rational combinational therapy for these tumors.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "title": "After Nf1 loss in Schwann cells, inflammation drives neurofibroma formation.",
        "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are peripheral nerve tumors caused by bi-allelic loss of NF1 in the Schwann cell (SC) lineage. PNF are common in individuals with Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and can cause significant patient morbidity, spurring research into potential therapies. Immune cells are rare in peripheral nerve, whereas in PNF 30% of the cells are monocytes/macrophages. Mast cells, T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) are also present. NF1 mutant neurofibroma SCs with elevated Ras-GTP signaling resemble injury-induced repair SCs, in producing growth factors and cytokines not normally present in SCs. This provides a cytokine-rich environment facilitating PNF immune cell recruitment and fibrosis. We propose a model based on genetic and pharmacologic evidence in which, after loss of Nf1 in the SC lineage, a lag occurs. Then, mast cells and macrophages are recruited to nerve. Later, T cell/DC recruitment through CXCL10/CXCR3 drives neurofibroma initiation and sustains PNF macrophages and tumor growth. Stat3 signaling is an additional critical mediator of neurofibroma initiation, cytokine production, and PNF growth. At each stage of PNF development therapeutic benefit should be achievable through pharmacologic modulation of leukocyte recruitment and function.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "title": "New insights into the neurofibroma tumor cells of origin.",
        "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a debilitating inherited tumor syndrome affecting around 1 in 3000 people. Patients present with a variety of tumors caused by biallelic loss of the tumor suppressor neurofibromin (NF1), a negative regulator of Ras signaling. While the mechanism of tumor formation is similar in the majority of NF1 cases, the clinical spectrum of tumors can vary depending on spatiotemporal loss of heterozygosity of NF1 in cells derived from the neural crest during development. The hallmark lesions that give NF1 its namesake are neurofibromas, which are benign Schwann cell tumors composed of nervous and fibrous tissue. Neurofibromas can be found in the skin (cutaneous neurofibroma) or deeper in body near nerve plexuses (plexiform neurofibroma). While neurofibromas have been known to be Schwann cell tumors for many years, the exact timing and initiating cell has remained elusive. This has led to difficulties in developing animal models and successful therapies for NF1. A culmination of recent genetic studies has finally begun to shed light on the detailed cellular origins of neurofibromatosis. In this review, we will examine the hunt for neurofibroma tumor cells of origin through a historical lens, detailing the genetic systems used to delineate the source of plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas. Through these novel findings, we can better understand the cellular, temporal, and developmental context during tumor initiation. By leveraging this data, we hope to uncover new therapeutic targets and mechanisms to treat NF1 patients.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "title": "Downregulation of PD-L1 via FKBP5 by celecoxib augments antitumor effects of PD-1 blockade in a malignant glioma model.",
        "abstract": "Antitumor therapies targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or its ligand-1 (PD-L1) are used in various cancers. However, in glioblastoma (GBM), the expression of PD-L1 varies between patients, and the relationship between this variation and the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody therapy remains unclear. High expression levels of PD-L1 affect the proliferation and invasiveness of GBM cells. As COX-2 modulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, we tested the hypothesis that the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib potentiates anti-PD-1 antibody treatment via the downregulation of PD-L1.Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice injected with murine glioma stem cells (GSCs) were randomly divided into four groups treated with vehicle, celecoxib, anti-PD-1 antibody, or celecoxib plus anti-PD-1 antibody and the antitumor effects of these treatments were assessed. To verify the mechanisms underlying these effects, murine GSCs and human GBM cells were studied in vitro.Compared with that with each single treatment, the combination of celecoxib and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment significantly decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival. The high expression of PD-L1 was decreased by celecoxib in the glioma model injected with murine GSCs, cultured murine GSCs, and cultured human GBM cells. This reduction was associated with post-transcriptional regulation of the co-chaperone FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5).Combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibody plus celecoxib might be a promising therapeutic strategy to target PD-L1 in glioblastoma. The downregulation of highly-expressed PD-L1 via FKBP5, induced by celecoxib, could play a role in its antitumor effects.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

We here performed translational research on material derived from this clinical trial to identify patients that benefit from this treatment.Targeted DNA-sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis was performed on clinical trial samples. High-throughput, high-content imaging analysis was done to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the survival benefit.We first define the tumor genomic landscape in this well-annotated patient population. We find that tumors harboring EGFR single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) have improved outcome in the depatux-m + TMZ combination arm. Such SNVs are common to the extracellular domain of the receptor and functionally result in a receptor that is hypersensitive to low-affinity EGFR ligands. These hypersensitizing SNVs and the ligand-independent EGFRvIII variant are inversely correlated, indicating two distinct modes of evolution to increase EGFR signaling in glioblastomas. Ligand hypersensitivity can explain the therapeutic efficacy of depatux-m as increased ligand-induced activation will result in increased exposure of the epitope to the antibody-drug conjugate. We also identified tumors harboring mutations sensitive to \"classical\" EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, providing a potential alternative treatment strategy.These data can help guide treatment for recurrent glioblastoma patients and increase our understanding into the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR signaling in these tumors.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Extremely strong associations between male hormone-interfering drugs and meningiomas have been reported in two previous studies, but these findings are limited by small size of the study populations and possibly by surveillance- and selection bias. Thus, such possible and indeed very interesting association must be investigated in a large, unselected cohort. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine whether patients exposed to male hormone-interfering drugs had a higher risk of meningioma development in a nationwide cohort study.A retrospective Danish nationwide cohort study with follow-up from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2016. Exposure was use of male hormone-interfering drugs (5-&#945;-reductase-inhibitors, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, steroidal antiandrogen, and nonsteroidal antiandrogen). Hazard ratio of first-time diagnosis of meningioma according to drug use was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for age and birth year.The cohort included 244,696 men of which 64,047 had used male hormone-interfering drugs. Overall 444 meningiomas occurred during follow-up. No significant association was observed between use of male hormone-interfering drugs and the occurrence of meningioma (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.82-1.27). Similar results were observed 0-1, 2-4, and 5+ years after first use. In explorative analyses, no elevated risk association was observed for specific drugs (5-&#945;-reductase-inhibitors, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, steroidal antiandrogen, and nonsteroidal antiandrogen).As opposed to previous studies, we found no evidence of an increased risk of meningioma in men treated with male hormone-interfering drugs.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

We hypothesized that dexamphetamine sulfate, a psychostimulant drug, could improve fatigue in PBT patients.A double-blind, phase III, multi-institutional, placebo-controlled randomized trial (1:1 allocation) assessed the efficacy and tolerability of dexamphetamine at a dosage of 30&#160;mg/day in PBT patients with stable disease who complained of severe fatigue, defined as a Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) score &#8805;60. The primary outcome was the variation of the MFI 20 score between inclusion and the evaluation at 3&#160;months in nonprogressive patients. Mood, QOL and cognitive function were also evaluated.From April 2013 to November 2016, 46 patients were enrolled in the study, 41 of whom were evaluable for analysis (dexamphetamine group: 22; placebo group: 19). Tolerance was generally good, with no treatment-related deaths and no grade 4 toxicity.

        "abstract": "As a cancer predisposition syndrome, individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk for the development of both benign and malignant tumors. One of the most common locations for these cancers is the central nervous system, where low-grade gliomas predominate in children. During early childhood, gliomas affecting the optic pathway are most frequently encountered, whereas gliomas of the brainstem and other locations are observed in slightly older children. In contrast, the majority of gliomas arising in adults with NF1 are malignant cancers, typically glioblastoma, involving the cerebral hemispheres. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of NF1-associated gliomas has been significantly advanced through the use of genetically engineered mice, yielding new targets for therapeutic drug design and evaluation. In addition, Nf1 murine glioma models have served as instructive platforms for defining the cell of origin of these tumors, elucidating the critical role of the tumor microenvironment in determining tumor growth and vision loss, and determining how cancer risk factors (sex, germline NF1 mutation) impact on glioma formation and progression. Moreover, these preclinical models have permitted early phase analysis of promising drugs that reduce tumor growth and attenuate vision loss, as an initial step prior to translation to human clinical trials.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

This study analyzed data from the European \"Care for CMMRD\" (C4CMMRD) database to describe their clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcome with the aim of improving its diagnosis/treatment.Retrospective analysis of data on patients with CMMRD and malignant BT from the C4CMMRD database up to July 2017.Among the 87 registered patients, 49 developed 56 malignant BTs: 50 high-grade gliomas (HGG) (with giant multinucleated cells in 16/21 histologically reviewed tumors) and 6 embryonal tumors. The median age at first BT was 9.2 years [1.1-40.6], with nine patients older than 18. Twenty-seven patients developed multiple malignancies (including16 before the BT). Most patients received standard treatment, and eight patients immunotherapy for relapsed HGG. The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 30% (95% CI: 19-45) and 22% (95% CI: 12-37) after the first BT, with worse prognosis for HGG (3-year OS = 20.5%). Six patients were alive (median follow-up 2.5 years) and 43 dead (38 deaths, 88%, were BT-related). Other CMMRD-specific features were caf&#233;-au-lait macules (40/41), multiple BTs (5/15), developmental brain anomalies (11/15), and consanguinity (20/38 families).Several characteristics could help suspecting CMMRD in pediatric malignant BTs: giant cells on histology, previous malignancies, parental consanguinity, caf&#233;-au-lait macules, multiple BTs, and developmental brain anomalies. The prognosis of CMMRD-associated BT treated with standard therapies is poor requiring new therapeutic up-front approaches.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Targeted approaches for inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in glioblastoma (GBM) have led to therapeutic resistance and little clinical benefit, raising the need for the development of alternative strategies. Endogenous LRIG1 (Leucine-rich Repeats and ImmunoGlobulin-like domains protein 1) is an RTK inhibitory protein required for stem cell maintenance, and we previously demonstrated the soluble ectodomain of LRIG1 (sLRIG1) to potently inhibit GBM growth in vitro and in vivo.Here, we generated a recombinant protein of the ectodomain of LRIG1 (sLRIG1) and determined its activity in various cellular GBM models including patient-derived stem-like cells and patient organoids. We used proliferation, adhesion, and invasion assays, and performed gene and protein expression studies. Proximity ligation assay and NanoBiT complementation technology were applied to assess protein-protein interactions.We show that recombinant sLRIG1 downregulates EGFRvIII but not EGFR, and reduces proliferation in GBM cells, irrespective of their EGFR expression status. We find that sLRIG1 targets and downregulates a wide range of RTKs, including AXL, and alters GBM cell adhesion. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LRIG1 interferes with AXL but not with EGFR dimerization.These results identify AXL as a novel sLRIG1 target and show that LRIG1-mediated RTK downregulation depends on direct protein interaction. The pan-RTK inhibitory activity of sLRIG1 warrants further investigation for new GBM treatment approaches.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

The effects of HCMV systemic infection on survival in GBM patients, however, are largely unknown. We aimed to determine the association between HCMV serostatus at diagnosis and survival via a retrospective cohort study of GBM patients.Plasma from 188 GBM patients treated at the Ben and Catherine Ivy Center (Seattle, WA) was tested for HCMV serostatus via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of anti-HCMV immunoglobulin (Ig)G. HCMV IgG serostatus was analyzed with respect to each patient's progression-free and overall survival (OS) via log-rank and multivariable Cox regression analysis.Ninety-seven of 188 (52%) patients were anti-HCMV IgG seropositive. Median OS was decreased in the IgG+ cohort (404 days) compared to IgG- patients (530 days; P = .0271). Among O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated patients (n = 96), median OS was significantly decreased in IgG+ patients (336 days) compared to IgG- patients (510 days; P = .0094). MGMT methylation was associated with improved OS in IgG+ patients versus those who were unmethylated (680 vs 336 days; P = .0096), whereas no such association was observed among IgG- patients.In this study, HCMV seropositivity was significantly associated with poorer OS in GBM patients. This finding suggests prior infection with HCMV may play an important role in GBM patient outcomes, and anti-HCMV antibodies may, therefore, prove a valuable prognostic tool in the management of GBM patients.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

TAMs display functional phenotypic diversity and may establish either an inflammatory and anti-tumoral or an immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral microenvironment. TAM subtypes present in meningioma and potential contribution to growth and recurrence is unknown.Immunofluorescence staining was used to quantify M1 and M2 TAM populations in tissues obtained from 30 meningioma patients. Associations between M1 and M2 cells, M1:M2 cell ratio to tumor characteristics, WHO grade, recurrence, size, location, peri-tumoral edema, and patient demographics such as age and sex were examined.TAM cells accounted for ~18% of all cells in meningioma tissues. More than 80% of infiltrating TAMs were found to be of pro-tumoral M2 phenotype and correlated to tumor size (P = .0409). M1:M2 cell ratio was significantly decreased in WHO grade II, compared to grade I tumors (P = .009).

However, the location of a brain metastasis is not included in any validated prognostic nomogram and it is unclear if this is due to a lack of a relationship or a lack of support from published data. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature focusing on studies that have investigated a relationship between brain metastasis location and clinical outcomes, including patient survival. The vast majority of reports anatomically categorized brain metastases as supratentorial or infratentorial whereas some reports also considered other subdivisions of the brain, including different lobes or with particular areas defined as eloquent cortex. Results were variable across studies, with some finding a relationship between metastasis location and survival, but the majority finding either no relationship or a weak correlation that was not significant in the context of multivariable analysis. Here, we highlight the key findings and limitations of many studies, including how neurosurgical resection might influence the relative importance of metastasis location and in what ways future analyses may improve anatomical categorization and resection status.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain neoplasm with median overall survival (OS) around 15 months. There is a dearth of effective monitoring strategies for patients with high-grade gliomas. Relying on magnetic resonance images of brain has its challenges, and repeated brain biopsies add significant morbidity. Hence, it is imperative to establish a less invasive way to diagnose, monitor, and guide management of patients with high-grade gliomas. Currently, multiple biomarkers are in various phases of development and include tissue, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and imaging biomarkers. Here we review and summarize the potential biomarkers found in blood and CSF, including extracellular macromolecules, extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells, immune cells, endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitor cells. The ability to detect tumor-specific biomarkers in blood and CSF will potentially not only reduce the need for repeated brain biopsies but also provide valuable information about the heterogeneity of tumor, response to current treatment, and identify disease resistance. This review also details the status and potential scope of brain tumor-related cranial devices and implants including Ommaya reservoir, microelectromechanical systems-based depot device, Alzet mini-osmotic pump, Metronomic Biofeedback Pump (MBP), ipsum G1 implant, ultra-thin needle implant, and putative devices. An ideal smart cranial implant will overcome the blood-brain barrier, deliver various drugs, provide access to brain tissue, and potentially measure and monitor levels of various biomarkers.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

We explored the DNA-damaging poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) niraparib in intracranial mouse models of breast cancer susceptibility protein (BRCA)-mutant TNBC.Mice bearing intracranial human-derived TNBC cell lines (SUM149, MDA-MB-231Br, or MDA-MB-436) were treated with niraparib and monitored for survival; intracranial tissues were analyzed for PAR levels and niraparib concentration by mass spectrometry. RNASeq data of primary breast cancers using The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed for DNA damage signatures. Combined RAD51 and PARP inhibition in TNBC cell lines was assessed in vitro by colony-forming assays.Daily niraparib increased median survival and decreased tumor burden in the BRCA-mutant MDA-MB-436 model, but not in the BRCA-mutant SUM149 or BRCA-wild-type MDA-MB-231Br models despite high concentrations in intracranial tumors. RAD51 inhibitor B02 was shown to sensitize all cell lines to PARP inhibition (PARPi). In the analysis of BRCA-mutant primary human TNBCs, gene expression predictors of PARPi sensitivity and DNA repair signatures demonstrate widespread heterogeneity, which may explain the differential response to PARPi. Interestingly, these signatures are significantly correlated to RAD51 expression including PARPi sensitivity (R 2 = 0.602, R 2= 0.758).Niraparib penetrates intracranial tumor tissues in mouse models of TNBC with impressive single-agent efficacy in BRCA-mutant MDA-MB-436. Clinical evaluation of niraparib to treat TNBC brain metastases, an unmet clinical need desperate for improved therapies, is warranted. Further compromising DNA repair through RAD51 inhibition may further augment TNBC's response to PARPi.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "MiR-142-3p has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. However, the regulatory effect of miR-142-3p on drug resistance of breast cancer cells and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. Here, we found that miR-142-3p was significantly downregulated in the doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant MCF-7&#160;cell line (MCF-7/DOX). MiR-142-3p overexpression increased DOX sensitivity and enhanced DOX-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a direct functional target of miR-142-3p in breast cancer cells and miR-142-3p negatively regulated HMGB1 expression. Moreover, overexpression of HMGB1 dramatically reversed the promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy mediated by miR-142-3p up-regulation. In conclusion, miR-142-3p overexpression may inhibit autophagy and promote the drug sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DOX by targeting HMGB1. The miR-142-3p/HMGB1 axis might be a novel target to regulate the drug resistance of breast cancer patients.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

        "abstract": "Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors. As transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the master regulators of the hypoxic microenvironment; their target genes function in tumorigenesis and tumor development. Intriguingly, both yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) play fundamental roles in the malignant progression of hypoxic tumors. As downstream effectors of the mammalian Hippo pathway, YAP and/or TAZ (YAP/TAZ) are phosphorylated and sequestered in the cytoplasm by the large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2)-MOB kinase activator 1 (MOB1) complex, which restricts the transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ. However, dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ have the ability to translocate to the nucleus where they induce transcription of target genes, most of which are closely related to cancer. Herein we review the tumor-related signaling crosstalk between YAP/TAZ and hypoxia, describe current agents and therapeutic strategies targeting the hypoxia-YAP/TAZ axis, and highlight questions that might have a potential impact in the future.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

        "abstract": "During recent years, there was growing demand in using microalga valuable products such as &#946;-carotene in health care. &#946;-Carotene has anti-cancer and anti-aging properties for human. In Dunaliella salina cells, &#946;-carotene has a major protecting role for biomolecules, when the production of reactive oxygen species is elevated. In the present study, we investigated the influence of the four most effective factors (light intensity, temperature, nitrate and salinity concentration) and their interactions on the &#946;-carotene production and the total chlorophyll/&#946;-carotene ratio in low light adapted D. salina cells. Box-Benken design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used for this purpose and optimization of the factor levels. Two models were developed to explain how &#946;-carotene productivity and the total chlorophyll/&#946;-carotene ratio may depend on the stress factors. Among the four stress variables for &#946;-carotene production, light intensity was stronger than the others. Meanwhile, interaction between light intensity and salt concentration exhibited the most important effect on the total chlorophyll/ &#946;-carotene ratio. The predicted optimal conditions for maximum &#946;-carotene productivity and minimum total chlorophyll/&#946;-carotene ratio were derived from the fitted model in 200 &#181;mol photons m-2s-1 light intensity, 25 &#186;C, 0.9 mM nitrate and 3.8 M NaCl. When the predicted condition was tested experimentally, the expected results were observed. This suggests that overproduction of &#946;-carotene in D. salina under certain conditions depends on used light intensity for preadaptation. The step-wise manner applying of stresses may act as a beneficial strategy to &#946;-carotene overproduction.",

Cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis activity, and suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were also evaluated. The anticancer activity of PAL was determined by observing the activity of these compounds against WiDr cells using the [3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol-2-il)-2,5-difenil tetrazolium bromida] MTT assay. Inhibition of the cell cycle and increased apoptosis were analysed by flowcytometry. Suppression of COX-2 was analysed using immunocytochemistry. PAL exhibited anticancer activity against WiDr cells with an IC50 of 173.775 &#956;g/mL. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the inhibition occurred in the G0-G1 phase, and apoptosis occurred in the early apoptosis phase. Furthermore, the result of an analysis of COX-2 expression showed that PAL enabled the suppression of COX-2 expression. PAL can be used as anticancer agents against WiDr colon cancer cells.

Nowadays, anticancer peptides (ACPs) are becoming promising anticancer drug candidates. This is due to several advantages inherited in peptide molecules, such as being usually with small size, high activity, low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility, diversity of sequence, and more modification sites for functionalization. To get benefit of these merits, in this work, we synthesized a new series of triazole- based analogues with peptide scaffold by employing click chemistry and evaluated their anticancer activities against breast, colon cancer cell lines as well as fibroblast cells using MTT assay. Our results suggest that peptide scaffolds containing 1H-1, 2, 3-triazole ring group are toxic against colon and breast cancer cells viability, and this effect was more pronounced on MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MCF-7 breast cells. As a conclusion, these designed peptide analogues may be good and safe candidates as future anticancer agents.",

DAPI staining and Flow cytometry techniques were employed to probe anticancer activities of the optimal formulations. The obtained results indicated that the average size of optimized ELT-NLCs was 109 &#177; 2 nm, while the optimal formulation of ELT-liposome was 130 &#177; 4 nm. In addition, the values of EE, DL, and cellular uptake were higher in ELT-NLCs than ELT-liposome. Moreover, the stability of ELT-NLCs and ELT-liposome were not significantly changed (P > 0.05) within storage time. The results of anti-cancer assessment indicated that ELT-NLCs caused more cell viability reduction than ELT-liposome and free ELT. According to the Flow cytometry and DAPI staining results, the exposed A549 cells with ELT-NLCs had more rates of apoptosis than ELT-liposome. The obtained data from this study clearly showed that ELT-NLCs had better anti-cancer activity than ELT-liposome, which may be related to the effective nano particle size, PDI, EE, and DL of ELT-NLCs.",

In order to solve this dilemma, we have designed a novel co-delivery strategy to construct a co-loaded liposome of berberine (BER) and doxorubicin (DOX), which was called LipoBeDo. The optimal synergistic ratio of the two drugs was screened by cell cytotoxicity experiments in vitro, and the optimal attenuation ratio was further determined by in vivo cardiac H&E staining pathological sections. The optimal combination treatment caused a robust increase in apoptotic cells of 4T1, as compared to drug alone treatment. The prepared co-loaded liposome, LipoBeDo, had high encapsulation efficiency and good stability. The nanoliposome carrier controlled the biological fate of the drugs and maintained a pre-defined optimal ratio in vivo. The LipoBeDo significantly inhibited tumor growth in 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model compared with Doxil (P < 0.05), and completely overcame the myocardial rupture toxicity caused by Doxil in mice. Our co-loaded liposome delivery platform technology provided a new direction for the clinical treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and the safe application of DOX.&#169; 2019 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

        "abstract": "Cancer is a big challenge that has plagued the human beings for ages and one of the most effective treatments is chemotherapy. However, the low tumor-targeting ability limits the wide clinical application of chemotherapy. The microenvironment plays a critical role in many aspects of tumor genesis. It generates the tumor vasculature and it is highly implicated in the progression to metastasis. To maintain a suitable environment for tumor progression, there are special microenvironment in tumor cell, such as low pH, high level of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and more special enzymes, which is different to normal cell. Microenvironment-targeted therapy strategy could create new opportunities for therapeutic targeting. Compared to other targeting strategies, microenvironment-targeted therapy strategy will control the drug release into tumor cells more accurately. Redox responsive drug delivery systems (DDSs) are developed based on the high level of GSH in tumor cells. However, there are also GSH in normal cell though its level is lower. In order to control the release of drugs more accurately and reduce side effects, other drug release stimuli have been introduced to redox responsive DDSs. Under the synergistic reaction of two stimuli, redox dual-stimuli responsive DDSs will control the release of drugs more accurately and quickly and even increase the accumulation. This review summarizes strategies of redox dual-stimuli responsive DDSs such as pH, light, enzyme, ROS, and magnetic guide to delivery chemotherapeutic agents more accurately, aiming at providing new ideas for further promoting the drug release, enhancing tumor-targeting and improving anticancer effects. To better illustrate the redox dual-stimuli responsive DDS, preparations of carriers are also briefly described in the review.&#169; 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.",

        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment can be realistically viewed as an active battle ground between the host immune system and the growing tumor cells. This reactive space surrounding the tumor possesses several possibilities and facilitates the progression of a tumor from a neoplastic stage to that of metastasis. The contemporary approach of understanding the cancer biology from a \"within the cell\" perspective has been largely challenged with complex and intricate \"outside the cell\" events. Thus understanding the biology of the tumor microenvironment has been of scientific and clinical interest. Small non-coding microRNAs with a pleotropic and wide range of cellular gene targets can be reasonably hypothesized to regulate the events of carcinogenesis and progression. MicroRNAs have been investigated in different cancer models, and evidence of their involvement in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment has been of much interest. In particular, a major interest has been exploring the role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating the interaction of cancer cells with surrounding stromal components and the effect of such interactions on the cancer cells. Fine-tuned regulation by these microRNAs extends our contemporary understanding of these small biomolecules in epigenetic regulations. This review focuses on microRNAs that are dysregulated in ovarian carcinomas, their effect on the components of the tumor microenvironment, and the correlation of their heterogeneous expression profiles with disease severity and prognosis in patients. In addition, this paper also discusses the differential expression of exosomal microRNAs that are known to link the cancer cell with its microenvironment, facilitating the development of an improved prognostic/diagnostic marker and effective therapeutic regime.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

The aim of this study is to identify unmet needs of meningioma patients, caregivers, and health care providers.We adopted a patient-centered approach by using qualitative interviewing with patients diagnosed with a meningioma who have undergone treatment in the last 10 years since the date of their interview. Informal caregivers (family and/or friends) of the patient population and health care providers who are normally involved in the management and care of meningioma patients were also interviewed. Interview transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis.Of the 50 participants interviewed, there were 30 patients, 12 caregivers, and 8 health care professionals. Thematic analysis revealed 4 overarching themes: (1) access to targeted postoperative care, (2) financial struggles for patients and their families, (3) lack of information specific to meningiomas and postsurgical management, and (4) lack of psychosocial support.This study identified supportive needs specific to the meningioma patient population, which predominantly falls within the postoperative phase. The postoperative journey of this patient population could potentially extend to the rest of the patient's life, which necessitates resources and information directed to support postoperative recovery and management. The development of directly relevant supportive resources that support meningioma patients in their postoperative recovery is necessary to improve the health-related quality of life in this patient population.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

Five-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and factors affecting survival were compared using the log-rank test.Fifty-three patients age 1-14 years (median, 11 years) were included in this study. The median follow-up time was 63 months. The 5-year EFS and OS rates were 94.3% and 96.2% for all patients, respectively. No statistical difference in OS or EFS was observed between the data of recipients in the carboplatin-based and historical cisplatin-based therapies in our institutes. Concerning radiotherapy, omission of radiotherapy or focal irradiation results in worse long-term survival outcomes, but reduction in dose of radiotherapy to less than 40 Gy did not cause any negative impact on survival rates. Furthermore, carboplatin was associated with lower rates of hearing loss than cisplatin (5.7% vs 87.5%).Induction chemotherapy with carboplatin-based regimens was associated with excellent survival rates and low ototoxicity in patients with IC-GCT.

The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making.We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion.Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P&#8201; = &#8201;.004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P = .008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P = .496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P&#8201; < .001).IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most lethal primary brain tumor in adults. Clinical trials in older patients with GBM have explored the use of single and multimodality treatment regimens with modest survival benefits; however, trial criteria are commonly based on chronological age and do not reflect the heterogeneity of this cohort. Geriatric assessment (GA) techniques predict survival and treatment tolerance in other tumor sites and thus may objectively guide the decision-making process, but data are lacking in the neuro-oncology cohort.We performed a prospective, multicenter feasibility study involving patients age 65 years or older with newly diagnosed GBM. A modified GA was undertaken in the outpatient setting prior to starting treatment. Feasibility was determined primarily by recruitment rate, alongside data completeness, impact on clinic time, and acceptability to patients and staff. Factors associated with survival were explored using Cox regression models.Fifty patients were recruited within a prespecified time period with a recruitment rate of 82% (target 80%). Data completeness was greater than 80% in all except one assessment. Median overall survival was 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0-14.0 months). Among the GA screening factors analyzed, a baseline impaired Montreal Cognitive Assessment (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7, 95% CI 1.128-6.530) and impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (HR = 2.9 95% CI 0.983-8.541) were associated with poorer survival.In the first study of this kind among elderly GBM patients, we have shown that undertaking a neurologically focused GA screen is feasible and may provide useful prognostic information.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with poor prognosis, large morbidity burden, and limited treatment options. This analysis evaluated real-world treatment patterns, overall survival, resource use, and costs among Medicare patients with GBM.This retrospective observational study evaluated Medicare patients age 66 years or older with newly diagnosed GBM using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data from 2007 through 2013. Patients were followed from diagnosis to death or end of follow-up. An algorithm defined treatment patterns as lines of therapy (LOTs). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival for the full sample as well as by LOT, surgical resection, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), tumor size, and age. Resource use and costs during the follow-up period were reported in terms of total and per-patient-per-month (PPPM) estimates.A total of 4308 patients with GBM were identified (median age, 74 years; CCI of 0, 52%). The most commonly used first LOT was temozolomide (82%), whereas chemotherapy + bevacizumab was most prevalent for second-line (42%) and third-line (58%) therapy. The median overall survival was 5.9 months for resected patients and 3 months for unresected patients, with considerable heterogeneity depending on patient characteristics. A great proportion of patients had claims for an ICU admission (86.2%), skilled nursing facility (76.9%), and home health (56.0%) in the postdiagnosis period. The cumulative mean cost was $95 377 per patient and $18 053 PPPM, mostly attributed to hospitalizations.Limited treatment options, poor survival, and economic burden emphasize the need for novel interventions to improve care for Medicare patients with GBM.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Historical controls continue to be used in early-phase brain tumor trials. We aim to show that historical changes in survival trends for glioblastoma (GBM) call into question the use of noncontemporary controls.We analyzed data from 46 106 primary GBM cases from the SEER database (1998-2016). We performed trend analysis on survival outcomes (2-year survival probability, median survival, and hazard ratios) and patient characteristics (age, sex, resection extent, and treatment type).In 2005-2016 (ie, the post-Stupp protocol era), fitting a parameter independently to each year, there was a demonstrable increase in median survival (R2 = 0.81, P < .001) and 2-year survival probability (R2 = 0.55, P = .006) for GBM. Trend analysis of the hazard ratio showed a significant time-dependent downward trend (R2 = 0.62, P = .002). When controlling, via multivariable Cox regression modeling, for age, sex, resection extent, and treatment type, there was a persistent downward trend in hazard ratios with increases in calendar time, especially in the most recent data.Contemporary GBM patients face a different overall hazard profile from their historical counterparts, which is evident in changes in measures of patient survival and parametric hazard modeling. Though there was a plateau in these measures before 2005 (pre-Stupp protocol), there is no evidence of a new plateau in recent years even when controlling for known prognostic factors (age, sex, resection extent, and treatment type), suggesting that it may be insufficient to match contemporary patients and noncontemporary controls on the basis of these factors.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

Of these, 865 patients completed the online questionnaire, 697 returned written consent, 583 sent a pathology report, and 569 returned a saliva specimen. The completed 569 participants did not differ by age or treatment from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data but were more likely to be female (67% vs 52%) and white (94.8% vs 84%). Patients learned of the study through the Acoustic Neuroma Association (ANA) website (61.3%), ANA support group members (18%), and social media (primarily Facebook). Costs per patient enrolled were approximately 10% to 20% that of traditional registry-based enrollment methods. Results for the LGG study were similar.Although additional effort will be required to ensure a diverse participant population, partnership with established patient organizations along with use of web-based technology and social media allowed for the successful enrollment of neuro-oncology patients at a fraction of the cost relative to traditional methods.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Taking into account the rising trend of the incidence of cancers of various organs, effective therapies are urgently needed to control human malignancies. However, almost all chemotherapy drugs currently on the market cause serious side effects. Fortunately, several studies have shown that some non-toxic biological macromolecules, including algal polysaccharides, possess anti-cancer activities or can increase the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy drugs. Polysaccharides are characteristic secondary metabolites of many algae. The efficacy of polysaccharides on the normal and cancer cells is not well investigated, but our investigations proved a cell specific effect of a newly isolated extracellular polysaccharide from the red microalga Porphyridium sordidum. The investigated substance was composed of xylose:glucose and galactose:manose:rhamnose in a molar ratio of 1:0.52:0.44:0.31. Reversible electroporation has been exploited to increase the transport through the plasma membrane into the tested breast cancer tumor cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. Application of 75&#160;&#181;g/mL polysaccharide in combination with 200&#160;V/cm electroporation induced 40% decrease in viability of MDA-MB231 cells and changes in cell morphology while control cells (MCF10A) remained with normal morphology and kept vitality.&#169; 2019 WILEY&#8208;VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "Cancer is a worldwide increasing burden and its therapy is often challenging and causes severe side effects in healthy tissue. If drugs are loaded into nanoparticles, side effects can be reduced, and efficiency can be increased via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. This effect is based on the fact that nanoparticles with sizes from 10 to 200&#160;nm can accumulate in tumor tissue due to their leaky vasculature. In this work, we produced polycaprolactone (PCL) in the sizes 1.8, 5.4, and 13.6&#160;kDa and were able to produce spherical shaped nanoparticles with mean diameters of 64 &#177; 19&#160;nm out of the PCL5.4 and 45 &#177; 8&#160;nm out of the PCL13.6 reproducibly.

        "abstract": "Many personal care products on the market contain endocrine disrupting chemicals, including parabens. Parabens are well known chemical additives used as preservatives. They have been found in mammary glands and breast cancer tissues. At the same time, the general public is increasingly exposed to plastic micro- and nanoparticles generated during plastic production and waste disposal. Exposure to chemical cocktails is a realistic scenario of high public health interest, in which many types of compounds such as these two may exhibit synergistic or additive adverse effects. This study evaluated the effects of plastic nanoparticles, parabens, and their mixture on the viability and proliferation of two human breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB 231, which lacks oestrogen receptors, and MCF-7, which expresses these receptors. Parabens increased proliferation of oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells, and this effect became synergistic in the presence of plastic nanoparticles. The mechanism behind synergy may be related to the translocation and adsorption properties of nanoplastics, which served as a Trojan horse to expose cells to parabens more efficiently. These preliminary findings support growing evidence warning about the urgent problem of human exposure to combinations of plastic waste and contingent chemicals.",

We classified imaging tests as clinically prompted or routinely ordered and determined whether each test led to changes in patient care. A generalized estimating equation model was used to determine if patient characteristics predicted routine studies more likely to change care. We analysed routine tests that were exclusively preceded by consecutive tests that did not change care to determine if their yield differed by time since trastuzumab start and the number of prior tests that did not change care.We identified 448 patients who received 1735 cardiac imaging studies after trastuzumab initiation. Of 1555 routine tests, 44 led to changes in care (2.8%) for 43 patients, whereas 50 of 180 clinically prompted tests (27.8%) altered care in 29 patients (P-value < 0.001). Earlier stage cancer, diabetes, prior anthracyclines, and prior cardiovascular disease were associated with a higher likelihood of changes in care following routine tests (P-value < 0.05). Among routine tests that were exclusively preceded by consecutive tests that did not change care, tests ordered outside months 3-9 and those that followed &#8805; 3 tests were even less likely to change care.Routine cardiac imaging tests rarely changed care for trastuzumab-treated patients with breast cancer, particularly among lower risk anthracycline-na&#239;ve women who had multiple prior tests that did not change care.Copyright &#169; 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

        "abstract": "It has been suggested that lack of ongoing registration of patient-centered outcomes has resulted in existing care trajectories that have not been optimized for sequelae experienced by meningioma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the structure of current meningioma care and identify issues and potential high-impact improvement initiatives.Using the grounded theory approach, a thematic framework was constructed based on the Dutch Comprehensive Cancer Organisation survey about issues in meningioma care trajectories. This framework was used during 3 semistructured interviews and 2 focus groups with patient-partner dyads (n = 16 participants), and 2 focus groups with health care providers (n = 11 participants) to assess issues in current meningioma care trajectories and possible solutions, including barriers to and facilitators for implementation.Identified issues (n = 18 issues) were categorized into 3 themes: availability and provision of information, care and support, and screening for (neurocognitive) rehabilitation. A lack of information about the intervention and possible outcomes or complications, lack of support after treatment focusing on bodily and psychological functions, and reintegration into society were considered most important. Sixteen solutions were suggested, such as appointment of case managers (solution for 11/18 issues, 61%), assessment and treatment by physiatrists (22%), and routine use of patient-reported outcome measures for patient monitoring (17%). Barriers for these solutions were lack of budget, capacity, technology infrastructure, and qualified personnel with knowledge about issues experienced by meningioma patients.This study identified issues in current multidisciplinary meningioma care that are considered unmet needs by patients, partners, and health care providers and could guide innovation of care.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

Age, gender, duration of complaints, previous therapies, systemic signs and symptoms, lymph node characteristics and laboratory findings were recorded. The frequency of malignancy was calculated.One hundred thirty-four patients (34 girls) with a median age of six years (range four months-17 years) were included in our study. The majority of the patients (98%) had localized lymphadenopathy and the head and neck region was the most common site of involvement (87%). The median long-axis diameter of lymph nodes ranged between 0.5 cm and 5 cm (median 2 cm) by physical examination. Twenty-one patients (15.6%) had lymph node biopsy. Four patients had ruptured epidermal cyst, lymphangioma, pilomatricoma and ectopic thymus. Of the other biopsies, nine patients were diagnosed with reactive LAP, four with lymphadenitis, and four with Hodgkin's disease.

Islets of Diol-GF-treated DP-BB rats showed significantly lower insulitis and preserved higher plasma and pancreatic insulin levels. Diol-GF failed to change the proportion of lymphocyte subsets such as T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages in the spleen and blood. Diol-GF had no effect on the ability of DP-BB rat splenocytes to induce diabetes in recipients. Diol-GF and diol-ginsenoside Rb1 significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor &#945; production, whereas diol-ginsenosides Rb1 and Rd decreased interleukin 1&#946; production in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, mixed cytokine- and chemical-induced &#946;-cell cytotoxicity was greatly inhibited by Diol-GF and diol-ginsenosides Rc and Rd in RIN5mF cells.

Owing to few toxic side effects and strong enhancement on body immunity, ginseng has admirable application potential and value in cancer chemoprevention. The study aims at investigating the chemopreventive effects of ginseng on cutaneous carcinoma and the underlying mechanisms.The mouse skin cancer model was induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for identifying various ginsenosides, the main active ingredients of ginseng. Comprehensive approaches (including network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental verification) were used to explore the potential targets of ginseng.Ginseng treatment inhibited cutaneous carcinoma in terms of initiation and promotion. The content of Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd ginsenosides was the highest in both mouse blood and skin tissues. Ginseng and its active components well maintained the redox homeostasis and modulated the immune response in the model. Specifically, ginseng treatment inhibited the initiation of skin cancer by enhancing T-cell-mediated immune response through upregulating HSP27 expression&#160;and inhibited the promotion of skin cancer by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis through promoting nuclear translocation of Nrf2.According to the study results, ginseng can be potentially used for cutaneous carcinoma as a chemopreventive agent by enhancing cell-mediated immunity and maintaining redox homeostasis with multiple components, targets, and links.&#169; 2019 The Korean Society of Ginseng.

The 2011 NICE lung cancer guideline recommended that MRI or CT scan should be considered before treatment with curative intent, especially for (patients otherwise thought to have) stage III NSCLC.

        "abstract": "Potential benefits from earlier referral to palliative care have been described, at least for people with metastatic cancer, and include better symptom management and longer survival. However, the specification of supportive and palliative care services varies widely, and the elements of care provided to intervention and control groups in studies are not described. The definition of early or late referral also varies. Some people are referred whilst still receiving disease-modifying treatment, others when a decision has been taken to discontinue such treatment. The time period for people to be referred may be between the last 6 months to a year of life, to only a few weeks. For diseases or conditions with trajectories that are hard to predict, for example heart failure and COPD, or conditions where recovery from treatment is unlikely but still possible, it is difficult to define the criteria for early or late referral and to compare the effect of one timing against the other. Some conditions, such as some neurological diseases including dementia, may deprive a person of the ability to express their wishes regarding palliative care and, for them, it may be prudent to initiate discussions earlier after diagnosis.Copyright &#169; NICE 2019.",

        "title": "Evidence review: Barriers to accessing end of life care services: End of life care for adults: service delivery: Evidence review C",
        "abstract": "The NHS England Mandate (2013&#8211;15) sets an ambition for the NHS to deliver a &#8216;globally recognised&#8217; standard of end of life care. This is supported by an assessment of global end of life care performance in which our end of life care was rated the best in the world.581 However, people are still experiencing barriers to accessing good quality end of life care, or in some cases not accessing end of life care at all. In 2017 Hospice UK (e-hospice 3rd July Hospice UK analysis &#8216;One in four UK families who need end of life care miss out on crucial support&#8217;)350 estimated that one in four people, approximately 118,000, who require end of life care and their families are not able to access the expert care they need at the end of life, including hospice care or other support that they need. This is particularly true for people with conditions other than cancer and their analysis also showed that people from economically and socially deprived areas, BAME communities and LGBT people can experience barriers to accessing end of life care services. Barriers that prevent people in their last year of life accessing End of Life care can vary but poor communication and coordination of services is an ever-present theme. One of the biggest barriers is for professionals to recognise when someone has entered the last year of life and having the skills to discuss this with openness and sensitivity. This can be compounded by institutional culture, limited resource, restrictive internal policies and lack of training and education all contributing to people experiencing barriers to care during this period. Macmillan Cancer Support (Time to Choose &#8211; making choices at end of life 2013)483 also found similar barriers. Lack of information about the out-of-hours services, a reticence of some health care professionals to have &#8216;difficult conversations&#8217; with patients and carers and poor inter-professional communication can all have an impact on care. It is said that nearly three quarters of people with cancer would prefer to die at home and yet less than a third are able to do so. (Macmillan &#8211; A Time to Choose, 2013).483. While it is true that some will change their mind as their symptoms change, none-the-less there is a large gap between what people want and what they experience. In addition to the general barriers, there are other others specific to different communities and groups, for instance a 2014 Marie Curie and Alzheimer&#8217;s Society17 report highlights that &#8216;dementia is often not recognised as a terminal diagnosis, which can lead to poor access to care, inconsistent quality of care d&#8217;.. The ability of all health and care professionals to recognise when someone is entering the last year of life and the ability to be able to discuss end of life openly, honestly and sensitively are essential gateways to appropriate end of life care. This chapter reviews the themes found in qualitative work about the barriers to accessing end of life care.Copyright &#169; NICE 2019.",

        "title": "Evidence review: Optimal transition and facilitating discharge: End of life care for adults: service delivery: Evidence review M",
        "abstract": "Optimal transition between care settings for an adult who is approaching the end of their life is critical to providing the best standards of care and to meet the wishes and needs of the person set out in advance care plans. The consequences of a person dying in a setting which is inappropriate or not their preferred place of care can have considerable impact upon them and their carers, family and friends. The carers, family and friends&#8217; distress at the death may be exacerbated by the knowledge that it did not happen as the person who died wished.SMOOTH TRANSITIONS: Transition is a purposeful, planned process that addresses the medical, social and psychological needs of a person as they move from one system/place to another. Throughout this guideline many transition points have been identified, for example from one service provider to another, from one setting to another from one age group to another and from one life style to another. There appear to be no studies which are universally applicable to all transitions. Studies have included transitions between teams for example within a hospital or from hospital to home. Usually systems have been developed locally to meet identified problems with transitions, for example the use of a form or computer template, patient held records similar to those used in ante natal care. Probably the group where transition has been studied most is the transfer from children&#8217;s to young persons or adult services and most of this work has been undertaken in cancer service and for those with learning difficulties. Another area where work has been undertaken is in the discharge of people from hospital to home and the copying letters to patients is an initiative, which has its roots in this area. There appear to be some principles, which can help to make these transitions smoother. These include effective methods of communication, verbal, written, and electronic, between all those involved. It is most effective if the person who is being transferred and their relatives, carers and those important to them are all included. However there does not appear to be one factor that overwhelmingly contributes to a smooth discharge but a number of things which taken in combination makes transitions smoother. RAPID DISCHARGE: For patients who require rapid discharge to their preferred place of death (usually their home from hospital) there is a need for a clear process that allows for the timely initiation of resources with which to facilitate this care planning. This may or may not necessitate rapid access to specialist palliative care. It is dependent on the patient&#8217;s wishes being known to health care professional and relatives usually in the form of and Advanced Care Plan (ACP) and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and the ability of local system processes to enable the prompt implementation of support services once the patient has arrived at their preferred place of death. As with all rapid discharges what underpins them is effective communication with all parties and clear, concise documentation that allows for a smooth transition of care. With an ever-increasing pressure on services provided by health care providers, there is a widespread recognition that effective discharge planning from the time of admission is essential to enable a patient centred pathway, which is both safe and effective. The rapid discharge of patients is multi-factorial being dependent on realistic estimated day of discharge, senior decision making, effective communication, liaison with other health care partners, the families and most importantly the patient themselves. Much has been written in the literature regarding discharge, which has accumulated in national programmes such as the &#8216;SAFER&#8217; bundle and most recently the &#8216;End PJ paralysis&#8217; campaign both of which have seen improvements in improving the discharge process for patients.Copyright &#169; NICE 2019.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females. Patients with breast cancer have highly variable survival rates, indicating a need to identify prognostic biomarkers. By integrating multi-omics data (e.g., gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations (CNVs)), it is likely to improve the accuracy of patient survival predictions compared to prediction using single modality data. Therefore, we propose to develop a machine learning pipeline using decision-level integration of multi-omics tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict the overall survival of breast cancer patients. With multi-omics data consisting of gene expression, methylation, miRNA expression, and CNVs, the top performing model predicted survival with an accuracy of 85% and area under the curve (AUC) of 87%. Furthermore, the model was able to identify which modalities best contributed to prediction performance, identifying methylation, miRNA, and gene expression as the best integrated classification combination. Our method not only recapitulated several breast cancer-specific prognostic biomarkers that were previously reported in the literature but also yielded several novel biomarkers. Further analysis of these biomarkers could lend insight into the molecular mechanisms that lead to poor survival.",

While two photon and other optical microscopy systems have recently emerged in portable and wearable form, there is much less work reported on the portable and wearable photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) systems. Working towards this goal, we report our studies on a low-cost and portable photoacoustic microscopy system that uses a custom fabricated 2.5 mm diameter ring ultrasound transducer integrated with a fiber-coupled laser diode. The ultrasound transducer is centered at 17.25 MHz, and shows ~ 45% and ~ 100% fractional bandwidths for ultrasound pulse-echo and photoacoustic A-line signals respectively. To achieve overall system portability, besides the imaging head, other backend imaging system components need to be readily portable as well. In this direction, we have studied the potential use of compact pre-amplifiers, scanning stages and microcontroller based data acquisition and reconstruction for photoacoustic imaging. The portable PAM system is validated by imaging phantoms embedded with light absorbing targets. Future directions that will likely help achieve a completely portable and wearable photoacoustic microscopy system are discussed.",

The diagnosis of candidemia was established according to the single isolation of Candida spp. from blood culture and the presence of symptoms of infection.Over 12 years (2006-2017), candidemia was diagnosed in 75 patients aged 17 to 77 years (median 48 years). The causative agents of candidemia were C. albicans in 34.7% of patients, C. non - albicans - in 65.3%. Candidemia caused by C. albicans prevailed in patients of the older age group (median 56.5 years, p=0.04) and in patients with lymphoma (61.5%, p=0.01) with colonization of the gut by the same species of Candida (88.5%, p=0.002). Isolation of C. non - albicans from blood culture was more common in patients with acute leukemia (51%, p=0.01) and in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (22.5%, p=0.01). The ability to form biofilms was observed more frequently among C. non - albicans (59.2%) than C. albicans (19.2%, p=0.001). The clinical symptoms of candidemia were non - specific (fever was in 97%). Septic shock developed in 25 (33%) patients with comparable frequency in both groups.

In generalized lesions and progression of FL, the most commonly used courses are R-CHOP and R-B. The choice of therapy for different cytological types, clinical and laboratory parameters remains disputable.To analyze the clinical, laboratory, morphological parameters of patients with FL, who got R-B and R-CHOP therapy; determine the criteria for selecting induction therapy.The study included 203 patients with FL from 2000 to 2018. R-CHOP treatment was initiated in 126 patients, 14 of whom later received high - dose therapy (HDT) (R-DHAP: rituximab, dexamethasone, cisplatin, cytarabine) without autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT), 21 - HDT with autoSCT; treatment of 89 patients was limited to courses of R-CHOP and maintenance therapy with rituximab, two patients (in whom the disease progressed, despite R-CHOP therapy) were assigned the mNHL-BFM-90 program. The efficacy of treatment on various treatment regimens was evaluated primarily by overall survival.R-B. 77 patients received R-B therapy. Complete remission of the disease was achieved in 47/77 (61%) patients (3 of them later developed a relapse of the disease), partial remission was achieved in 15/77 (19%) patients, in 13/77 (17%) cases progression was recorded tumors. 70 patients had 1-2 cytological type of tumor, 6 patients - 3A cytological type. In cases of progression, 3 of 13 patients (46%) were diagnosed with 3A cytological type FL. Median observation (at the time of analysis) - 34 months. R-CHOP. 89 patients with FL received high - dose therapy with R-CHOP (6-8 courses) and maintenance therapy with rituximab. In 39 (44%) patients, the disease remained in remission, and in 50 (56%), a relapse of the disease developed. 50 patients had 1-2 cytological types, 39 - 3 cytological types. In cases of recurrence of FL, a 3A cytologic type (36%) was diagnosed in 18/50 patients. Median observation - 93 months. R-CHOP + HDT and autoSCT. 21 patients after the R-CHOP courses continued (due to insufficient antitumor response) high - dose chemotherapy (HDT) and auto-SCT were performed. In 18/21 (86%) cases, complete remission of the disease was achieved and maintained, in 3 (14%) cases relapse developed. 16 patients had 1-2 cytological types, 5 - 3 cytological types. Median observation - 81 months. R-CHOP + HDT without autoSCT. 14 patients started therapy under the R-CHOP program as induction therapy, but then (due to insufficient antitumor response), the treatment was continued according to the HDT without autoSCT. 11 (79%) patients are currently in remission of the disease, in 3 (21%) - there was a relapse. 10 patients had 2 cytological types of PL, 4 - 3 cytological types. 11 (79%) patients are currently in remission of the disease, in 3 (21%) - there was a relapse. Median observation - 80 months. 7-year OS of patients with FL on RB therapy was 89% (95% CI 75-99), on R-CHOP therapy - 85% (95% CI 73-90), on R-CHOP + HDT and autoSCT - 87% (95% CI 57-100), on R-CHOP + HDT without autoSCT - 82%. 7-year PFS of FL patients on RB therapy was 70% (95% CI 75-99), on R-CHOP therapy - 44% (95% CI 73-90), on R-CHOP + HDT and autoSCT - 74% (95% CI 57-100), on R-CHOP + HDT without autoSCT - 80%.The R-B is most effective in FL 1 and 2 cytological types. The cytological type does not correspond to the type of tumor growth: at 3A and 3A + 3B cytological types, nodular / nodular - diffuse and diffuse types of growth are found. When choosing an induction course, one should look at the cytological type of FL. A high proliferative activity index (according to Ki67) is a predictor of resistance to R-B therapy. The absence of an interfollicular T-cell reaction in tumor tissue FL is associated with tumor chemoresistance. The presence of the bulky factor is associated (in most patients) with the FLIPI index with values from 3 to 5, and is a predictor of a poor response to therapy. Patients with bulky, high (more than 35%) Ki67 index and FLIPI from 3 to 5 in the debut of the disease as the first line therapy, it is preferable to choose the R-CHOP mode, and in the absence of (after 4-6 courses) to complete or partial remission to continue conducting the HDT.",

Botkin Municipal Clinical Hospital. The control of the completeness of inclusion was carried out by cross - comparison with the data of the Moscow Cancer Register and the Register of Program 7 (beginning in 2019 - 12) of Highly Expensive Nosologies. The assessment was made according to data as of January 1, 2019. The calculations were carried out taking into account the data of Rosstat at the beginning of 2019 on the population of Moscow in different gender and age categories.Among the 3942 patients with active MM 1707 men - 43% and 2241 women - 57%, the median of the current age was 68 (28-94) years. The median time of observation of patients since the diagnosis of the disease 34 (1-423) months. The peak incidence was in the age range of more than 60 years. There were no significant differences in gender ratio in different age strata with a breakdown of 10 years. The number of cases of newly diagnosed MM per year for the period from 2009 (n=219) to 2018 (n=385) increased by 75.8%. At the same time, the demonstrated increase in the incidence rate for the described period turned out to be fair only for groups of patients over 50 years old, with the maximum increase in this indicator over the described period in the age range of 60-69 years. This is mainly due to the increase in life expectancy in Moscow in recent years. The study demonstrated that over the past 10 years, the average annual mortality rate from MM has decreased in Moscow, and as a result, its prevalence has increased. The rate of 2-year overall survival of patients with MM was 76%, 5-year - old - 49%, 10-year - old - 27%. The median overall survival of patients under the age of 65 when diagnosing the disease was 79 months, and 48 months. The distribution of patients within international classifications was consistent with international data.The study revealed a significant dynamic of the epidemiological situation concerning MM in Moscow. Over the past 10 years there has been an increase in the incidence of MM, as a result of an increase in the life expectancy of the population. The use of modern diagnostics and therapy of MM in real clinical practice has led to a significant reduction in mortality. Due to these factors, an increase in the prevalence of MM in Moscow has taken place, and this process will no doubt progress in the future.",

T-cell and B-cell clonality was assessed by GeneScan analysis of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCRG, TCRB) and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. For the quantitative determination of cells with RHOA G17V mutation real - time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with allele - specific LNA modified primers was used.In lymph nodes rearrangements of T-cell receptor genes were determined in 76 (90.5%) of 84 patients and were absent in 8 (9.5%) cases. Identification of the same clonal products of the TCRG and TCRB genes in the lymph node and in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow indicated the prevalence of the tumor process and was observed in 64.7% of patients. Clonal products in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow different from those in the lymph node indicated reactive cytotoxic lymphocyte population and were noted in 58.8% of AITL cases. Simultaneous detection of T- and B-cell clonality in the lymph node was observed in 20 (24.7%) of 81 patients. Cells with RHOA G17V mutation were detected in lymph node in 45 (54.9%) of 82 patients. The use of allele - specific PCR with LNA modified primers revealed presence of the tumor cells in peripheral blood in 100% and in bone marrow in 93.9% of patients with G17V RHOA mutation in the lymph nodes.The validity of different molecular assays performed on certain tissue samples for the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma has been evaluated. Quantitative allele - specific PCR assay for RHOA G17V mutation based on LNA modified primers possesses sufficient sensitivity for tumor process prevalence evaluation and minimal residual disease monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is aggressive B-cell neoplasm diagnosed predominantly among older men. R-CHOP-like regimens allow to achieve high response rate, but the overall survival (OS) are disappointingly short - 3-4 years. An addition of high - dose cytarabine to the upfront therapy and autoSCT significantly improved outcomes but remain feasible largely for medically fit patients. Based on the activity and good tolerance of gemcitabine - oxaliplatin schemes in relapsed and refractory MCL patients, we developed an alternative first - line course for patients who are not eligible for R-HD-MTX-AraC.Assess toxicity and efficacy of R-DA-EPOCH/ R-HD-MTX-AraC and R-DA-EPOCH/R-GIDIOX schemes, autoSCT and R-maintenance in untreated MCL patients.47 untreated MCL patients from 6 centers were enrolled in prospective study between April 2008 and September 2013. All patients have stage II-V; ECOG 0-3; median age 55 years (29-64); Male/Female 76%/24%. MIPIb: 28% low, 33% intermediate and 39% high risk. Following 1st R-EPOCH patients were assigned to receive either R-DA-EPOCH/ R-HD-MTX-AraC or R-DA-EPOCH/ R-GIDIOX regimen. In the absence of renal failure, hematological toxicity grade 4 more than 3 days and severe infections patients received R-HD-MTX-AraC scheme (R 375 mg/m2 Day 0, Methotrexate 1000 mg/m2/24 hours Day 1, AraC 3000 mg/m2 q 12 hrs Days 2-3). Patients who had at least one of these complications received R-GIDIOX scheme (R 375 mg/m2 day 0, gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 days 1 and 4, ifosfamide 1000 mg/m2 days 1-5, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 IV days 1-5, irinotecan 100 mg/m2 day 3, oxaliplatin 120 mg/m2 day 2). Subsequently these courses were alternating with R-DA-EPOCH in each arm of the protocol. Depending on the time of achieving CR patients received 6 or 8 courses, unless they progressed on therapy. Those patients who achieved PR/CR/CRu underwent autoSCT (BEAM-R). Post - transplant R-maintenance was administered for 3 years (R - 375 mg/m2 every 3 months).29/47 patients were treated on R-HD-MTX-AraC arm (median 50 years; MIPIb: 35.7% low, 28.6% intermediate, 35.7% high risk) and 18/47 patients were on R-GIDIOX arm (median 60 years; MIPIb: 16.7% low, 38.9% intermediate, 44.4% high risk). In R-HD-MTX-AraC arm CR rate was 96.5%. In R-GIDIOX arm OR and CR rates were 94.4% and 77.7% respectively. Main hematological toxicity of R-GIDIOX was leukopenia gr. 4 occurred in 74.1%. With median follow - up of 76 months, the estimated 7-years OS and EFS in R-HD-MTX-AraC arm are 76% and 57% respectively. In R-GIDIOX arm the estimated 7-years OS and EFS are 59% and 44%, respectively. There are no statistical differences in EFS (p=0.47) and OS (p=0.06) between two arms.The use of a risk - adapted strategy allowed 95.7% of patients achieve PR/CR/CRu, performed autoSCT and begun R-maintenance therapy with rituximab. None of the patients needed a premature discontinuation of therapy because of unacceptable toxicity. The performance of autoSCT and R-maintenance apparently allowed to partially offset differences in the intensity of induction therapy and to maintain comparable results of therapy in both induction arms.",

Diagnosis were established in all cases according to histological and immunohistochemical studies which made it possible to exclude the transformation of mature B-cell lymphoma into DLBCL.Isolated leptomeningeal involvement of CNS in the debut of the disease was detected in 1 (0.98%) out of 102 patients with DLBCL. Focal brain tissue involvement was not detected in any patient. More than half of the patients (54%) had a high risk of disease recurrence or progression with CNS involvement: in 8 (7.8%) patients had kidney/adrenal involvement, in the same proportion - bone marrow involvement, paranasal sinuses involvement - in 5 (4.9 %), epidural space - in 7 (6.9%) and breast - in 5 (4.9%) of patients. In 82 (80%) patients, a non-GCB (postgerminal differentiation of B-cell analog) molecular subtype of DLBCL was determined.The introduction of chemotherapy drugs into the spinal canal is recommended in isolated cases of leptomeningeal involvement of CNS at the time of DLBCL onset and is carried out according to standard recommendations. Prevention of relapse with involvement of central nervous system using intratecal chemotherapy in patients with nodal form of DLBCL is not indicated due to the absence of cases with disease progression or recurrence into CNS when patients were treated with R-m-NHL-BFM-90, R-DA-EPOCH and R-CHOP protocol.",

It was shown that the 5-years overall survival in AML younger than 60 years patients improved from 20 to 33%, in ALL - from 38 to 65%, in APL - from 0 to 95%. The cooperative work resulted in balanced clinical recommendations and protocols, reproducible in regional hospitals. Though till now there is a big difference in the long term outcome in acute leukemias patients treated in coordinating or regional centers mostly due to much higher early death rate: 7.5-9.5% vs 18-25%. This parameter should be used as criteria of the total efficacy of hematological service in each region of Russia. It became possible within the last years to integrate the minimal residual disease monitoring into clinical trials thus providing a clue parameter for choosing the further therapy - allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Non - chemotherapeutic approach with arsenic trioxide and all - trans retinoid acid had dramatically changed the toxicity and duration of treatment with very high efficacy. The Russian cooperative group was the first that started to include pregnant women with acute leukemias into clinical trials.

One way to reduce resistance to chemotherapy and its adverse effects is the so called targeted therapy, which targets specific molecules (\"molecular targets\") that play a critical role in cancer growth, progression, and metastasis. One such specific target are microtubules. In this review we address the current knowledge about microtubule-targeting agents or drugs (MTAs/MTDs) used in cancer therapy from their synthesis to toxicities. Synthetic and natural MTAs exhibit antitumor activity, and preclinical and clinical studies have shown that their anticancer effectiveness is higher than that of traditional drug therapies. Furthermore, MTAs involve a lower risk of adverse effects such as neurotoxicity and haemotoxicity. Several new generation MTAs are currently being evaluated for clinical use.

The aim of this study was to construct a comprehensive instrument for the appraisal of clinical practice guidelines in China (AGREE-CHINA), and to validate its reliability as a tool for helping potential guideline users in assessing guideline quality.First, an interdisciplinary working group was established for developing the methods. They also created a checklist as a tool according to the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) standards, considering the particularity of Chinese clinical practice. Next, the first draft of AGREE-China was developed by vote, modification, preliminary trial, and cross-verification. To ensure the objectivity, credibility, and reproducibility of the draft assessment, all of the checklists and standards were cross-reviewed fairly widely. Finally, AGREE-CHINA and AGREE II were used to assess the Chinese guidelines published in the past five years, and the results were compared.The presented AGREE-CHINA covered five main checkpoints (science and rigor, effectiveness and safety, economy, usability and feasibility, and conflicts of interest) with each point divided into several more specific checkpoints. Definitions and rationales for each main checkpoint appear in the Appendix. The quality ratings based on the total scores of AGREE-China and AGREE II were consistent (r = 0.508, P = 0.020). Compared with AGREE II, the study showed a higher level of interrater-reliability for AGREE-CHINA overall (ICC = 0.957, P < 0.001). The mean time required for AGREE-CHINA was less than that for AGREE II; this was approximately 30 minutes for every assessment. User satisfaction was generally high.This paper has presented the first edition of the AGREE-CHINA appraisal tool for clinical guidelines. It is quick and easy to use; it assesses and performs well in comparison to AGREE II.

For cases that are node negative, the role of definitive concurrent chemoradiation is unclear and not supported by guidelines but used at provider discretion. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the oncological outcomes with additional chemotherapy and factors correlated with the chemotherapy administration.We queried the National Cancer Database for patients with early stage (T2N0M0) laryngeal SCC treated nonsurgically. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of chemotherapy. Multivariable Cox regression evaluated predictors of survival. Propensity matching accounted for indication biases.We identified 7181 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, of which 1568 (22%) patients received chemotherapy in addition to radiation. Predictors of chemotherapy use included younger age, Caucasian race, more remote year of treatment, higher grade, sites other than glottis, treatment at a community cancer center, and use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Median overall survival was not significantly different in the two arms analyzed-65 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 60, 72months) with chemotherapy compared to 70 months without chemotherapy (95% CI 66, 75 months, P<.37). Predictors for survival on propensity-matched multivariable analysis were increased age, male sex, less education, lower income, higher comorbidity score, receipt of treatment at a community center, and nonglottic sites.This study shows no clear survival benefit with chemotherapy in early stage disease.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a broad overview of published scientific literature with respect to the effects of nicotine on three key health-related areas: 1) cardiovascular risk, 2) carcinogenesis and 3) reproductive outcomes. These areas are known to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of cigarette smoke, and in addition, nicotine has been hypothesized to play a role in disease pathogenesis. Acute toxicity will also be discussed. The literature to February 2019 suggests that there is no increased cardiovascular risk of nicotine exposure in consumers who have no underlying cardiovascular pathology. There is scientific consensus that nicotine is not a direct or complete carcinogen, however, it remains to be established whether it plays some role in human cancer propagation and metastasis. These cancer progression pathways have been proposed in models in vitro and in transgenic rodent lines in vivo but have not been demonstrated in cases of human cancer. Further studies are needed to determine whether nicotine is linked to decreased fertility in humans. The results from animal studies indicate that nicotine has the potential to act across many mechanisms during fetal development. More studies are needed to address questions regarding nicotine exposure in humans, and this may lead to additional guidance concerning new ENDS entering the market.Copyright: &#169; 2020 Price LR and Martinez J.",

Besides pulmonary tuberculosis in 97.7% of patients, patients were also treated for tuberculous pleurisy (0.9%), tuberculous laryngitis (0.6%), tuberculous meningitis (0.2%), tuberculous pericarditis (0.2%) and urogenital tuberculosis (0.4%). Out of the total number of patients, 57.3% declared themselves to be active smokers (men were predominant and made up to 80.8%) and 20.9% to be active alcohol consumers. Both risk factors, i.e. smoking and alcohol consumption, were present in 15.1% of all patients. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (30.4%), cardiac diseases (11.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8.0%). Lung carcinoma was the most common malignant disease (n=51), with Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated in 33% of them. Seventy-two of 464 (15.5%) patients had recurrences of tuberculosis. Of these, 30.5% had one of the risk factors (20.8% were smokers and 9.7% consumed alcohol), while 32.5% of patients had both risk factors. In conclusion, cigarette smoking was proved to be the most significant risk factor for development of pulmonary tuberculosis and its recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common problem and a significant cause of chronic gastric inflammation. H. pylori, ongoing gastric inflammation and its severity are the most critical component of precursors of gastric cancer. Hypothetically, every chronic tissue injury activates platelets, and the mean platelet volume (MPV) reflects this action well. The potential relationship between H. pylori and platelet count has been shown before. However, there are few and conflicting papers about the relationship between MPV and H. pylori related chronic gastric inflammation and its severity. The study aimed to assess any potential relationship between MPV and presence of H. pylori, as well as the severity of chronic gastric inflammation. A total of 6890 endoscopic reports were initially evaluated, and a total of 218 dyspeptic patients having undergone upper endoscopy were included. Of these, 118 (54.2%) were H. pylori positive and 100 (45.8%) were H. pylori negative. At least four gastric biopsies were obtained and evaluated according to Sydney classification. Age, gender, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, serum iron and C-reactive protein, as well as endoscopic findings were also recorded. A p<0.05 was accepted as significant. The MPV and platelet count did not differ between H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative groups of patients (p>0.05). There were no differences and correlation between MPV and gastric inflammation severity according to Sydney classification (p>0.05). When stratifying MPV as <9.15 fL and >9.15 fL, there was no difference between H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative groups either (p>0.05). In this study, we found no relationship between MPV and presence of H. pylori or severity of gastric inflammation. Although there are still conflicting publications on this issue, in our opinion and according to the results of this study, MPV is not a suitable marker for evaluation of gastric inflammation severity, being H. pylori either positive or negative.",

        "abstract": "Glutamine and glutamate are major bioenergy substrates for normal and cancer cell growth. Cancer cells need more biofuel than normal tissues for energy supply, anti-oxidation activity and biomass production. Genes related to metabolic chains in many cancers are somehow mutated, which makes cancer cells more glutamate dependent. Meanwhile, glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter for conducting signals through binding with different types of receptors in central neuron system. Interestingly, increasing evidences have shown involvement of glutamate signaling, guided through their receptors, in human malignancy. Dysregulation of glutamate transporters, such as excitatory amino acid transporter and cystine/glutamate antiporter system, also generates excessive extracellular glutamate, which in turn, activates glutamate receptors on cancer cells and results in malignant growth. These features make glutamate an attractive target for anti-cancer drug development with some glutamate targeted but blood brain barrier impermeable anti-psychosis drugs under consideration. We discussed the relevant progressions and drawbacks in this field herein.",

Variation in the burden in cancers in different regions of the world requires constant monitoring of the epidemiological situation in this regard. Assessing survival in cancer patients is a valuable source of information for patients and physicians alike, as well as for politicians who have a direct impact on the shaping of health policy and health systems. The aim of the present study was to assess the changes in the 5-year relative survival of colorectal cancer patients during 1995-2014.The data of 8,970 patients with colorectal cancer in the years 1995-2014, 5,033 males and 3,937 females aged 67.5 &#177; 11.7 from &#346;wi&#281;tokrzyskie Cancer Registry were used. Cases were classified according to the topographical codes ICD-O-3: C18.0-C18.9, C19.9, C20.9, C21.0-C21.2, C21.8. The end of follow-up was fixed at 31 December 2014. Four five-year calendar periods were defined. In each calendar period, relative survival rates using the Ederer II method were estimated separately for males and females.In 2010-2014 (against 1995-1999), the absolute increase in the 5-year relative survival in males and females with colon cancer was the highest and reached 9.8 percentage point (p.p.) and 9.6 p.p., respectively. Patterns of survival for both colon and rectal cancer patients according to gender and age were very similar.In 1995-2014, an increase in the value of relative survival rates of males and females with colorectal cancer was observed. Systematic increase in funding in health care was a chance for reducing the burden of colorectal cancer by more widespread and equal access of effective early detection and cancer treatment.",

Our aims were to determine the expression level of HOTTIP lncRNA in plasma samples of healthy individuals and CRC patients as well as their relationship with clinico-pathological characteristics of patients. First, total RNA was extracted from the plasma samples of 100 subjects including 50 patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy persons. Then, gene expression was measured using real-time PCR technique. The sensitivity and specificity of HOTTIP dysregulation in CRC and healthy individual's plasma was measured by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. As compared with healthy controls, HOTTIP lncRNA was over expressed in a statistically significant manner in plasma samples of patients (P=0.001). Significant relationship between HOTTIP expression and positive family history of CRC was observed, too (P=0.04). The ROC curve analysis showed an AUC value of 0.775, a specificity of 82%, a sensitivity of 76%, with a cut off value equal to 2.40 (P =0.001). HOTTIP transcript can be proposed as a new biomarker for early diagnosis due to the increased expression in plasma samples of patients with CRC and the relatively high sensitivity and specificity.",

        "abstract": "The York faecal calprotectin care pathway (YFCCP) was developed to optimise effective primary care differentiation between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We undertook an audit of colonoscopy activity at York Teaching Hospitals after the introduction of the YFCCP, to assess its impact.Faecal calprotectin (FC) results were reconciled with colonoscopy activity in patients 18-60 years after the implementation of the YFCCP. This permitted individual patient tracking of their FC values, the timing of those requests by primary care, the date of subsequent referral and investigation and the end clinical diagnoses.Primary care uptake of FC increased fourfold with the introduction of the YFCCP. Following implementation, FC-related referrals for colonoscopy fell from 24% to 13%. The number of patients needed to colonoscope to diagnose organic colonic disease (IBD, significant adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer) fell from 6.8 to 3.8 when the YFCCP was applied. This represents a cost saving of &#163;41 015 per thousand patients tested in primary care. We estimate that outpatient time to diagnosis fell from a median of 41 to 29 days.This audit of FC activity and colonoscopy outcomes provides substantial supportive evidence for the effectiveness of the YFCCP. Popular in primary care, it has led to a reduction in referrals. The diagnostic accuracy determined in this audit is in line with earlier evaluations. Accepting the weaknesses of audit we conclude that this evaluation likely underestimates the benefits of the YFCCP in terms of resource use saving and time to diagnosis.&#169; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Our aim is to evaluate the dosimetric differences of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and electron beam therapy (EBT) compared with 3-dimensional proton beam therapy (PBT).We evaluated a patient with recurrent angiosarcoma of the left temporal scalp after prior surgical resections and radiation therapy to 60 Gy in 30 fractions who needed reirradiation. We generated VMAT, EBT, and PBT plans using the Pinnacle Treatment Planning System (TPS). Both VMAT and EBT plans used a skin bolus, whereas no bolus was used for the proton plan. Doses to the OARs, including cochlea, eyes, lens, lacrimal glands, optic nerves, optic chiasm, pituitary gland, and underlying brain, were compared.The reirradiation treatment dose was 60 Gy(RBE). Target volume coverage was comparable in all plans. Compared with VMAT and EBT, the PBT plan showed reductions in mean and maximum doses to all OARs. Without the use of protons, several OARs would have exceeded dose tolerance utilizing VMAT or electrons. Dose reduction of up to 100% was achieved for central and contralateral OARs.Compared with VMAT and EBT, PBT resulted in dose reductions to all OARs, while maintaining excellent target coverage. PBT showed a significant advantage in treating superficially located skin cancers, such as angiosarcoma, without the need for a bolus. PBT can be considered in the upfront treatment and certainly in the reirradiation setting.&#169; Copyright 2019 The Author(s).",

Endpoints include local regional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), tumor response, and toxicity outcomes. Toxicity was graded as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier method were used.We treated 46 patients from March 2015 to August 2017. Median age was 58 years, 93.5% were male, 67% were nonsmokers, 98% had stage III-IVB disease per the 7th edition of the AJCC [American Joint Committee on Cancer] Cancer Staging Manual, and 89% were p16 positive. Twenty-eight patients received definitive IMPT to total dose of 70 to 74.4 Gy(RBE), and 18 patients received postoperative IMPT to 60 to 66 Gy(RBE) following transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Sixty-four percent of patients received concurrent systemic therapy. There were no treatment interruptions or observed acute grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Eighteen patients had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement; the majority (14) were placed prophylactically. The most common grade 3 acute toxicities were dermatitis (76%) and mucositis (72%). The most common late toxicity was grade 2 xerostomia (30%). At a median follow-up time of 19.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 11.2-28.4), primary complete response was 100% and nodal complete response was 92%. One patient required a salvage neck dissection owing to an incomplete response at 4 months. There were no recorded local regional or marginal recurrences, PFS was 93.5%, and OS was 95.7%.Our early results for IMPT in OPSCC are promising with no local regional or marginal recurrences and a favorable toxicity profile. Our data add to a body of evidence that supports the clinical use of IMPT. Randomized comparative trials are encouraged.&#169; Copyright 2019 The Author(s).",

        "title": "IMPMD: An Integrated Method for Predicting Potential Associations Between miRNAs and Diseases.",
        "abstract": "With the rapid development of biological research, microRNAs (miRNAs) have increasingly attracted worldwide attention. The increasing biological studies and scientific experiments have proven that miRNAs are related to the occurrence and development of a large number of key biological processes which cause complex human diseases. Thus, identifying the association between miRNAs and disease is helpful to diagnose the diseases. Although some studies have found considerable associations between miRNAs and diseases, there are still a lot of associations that need to be identified. Experimental methods to uncover miRNA-disease associations are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, effective computational methods are urgently needed to predict new associations.In this work, we propose an integrated method for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases (IMPMD). The enhanced similarity for miRNAs is obtained by combination of functional similarity, gaussian similarity and Jaccard similarity. To diseases, it is obtained by combination of semantic similarity, gaussian similarity and Jaccard similarity. Then, we use these two enhanced similarities to construct the features and calculate cumulative score to choose robust features. Finally, the general linear regression is applied to assign weights for Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression algorithms.IMPMD obtains AUC of 0.9386 in 10-fold cross-validation, which is better than most of the previous models. To further evaluate our model, we implement IMPMD on two types of case studies for lung cancer and breast cancer. 49 (Lung Cancer) and 50 (Breast Cancer) out of the top 50 related miRNAs are validated by experimental discoveries.We built a software named IMPMD which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Sunmile/IMPMD.&#169; 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with an increasing global incidence rate. Unfavorable prognosis largely results from associated difficulties in early diagnosis and the absence of prognostic and predictive biomarkers that would enable an individualized therapeutic approach. In fact, PaC prognosis has not improved for years, even though much efforts and resources have been devoted to PaC research, and the multimodal management of PaC patients has been used in clinical practice. It is thus imperative to develop optimal biomarkers, which would increase diagnostic precision and improve the post-diagnostic management of PaC patients. Current trends in biomarker research envisage the unique opportunity of cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) present in circulation to become a convenient, non-invasive tool for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to treatment. This review analyzes studies focused on cell-free miRNAs in PaC. The studies provide solid evidence that miRNAs are detectable in serum, blood plasma, saliva, urine, and stool, and that they present easy-to-acquire biomarkers with strong diagnostic, prognostic and predictive potential.&#169; 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",

For a very long time, it was believed that cancer is simply an outcome of changes at the genetic level but today, it has become a well-established fact that both genetics and epigenetics work together resulting in the transformation of normal cells to cancerous cells.In the present scenario, researchers are focusing on targeting epigenetic machinery. The main advantage of targeting epigenetic mechanisms is their reversibility. Thus, cells can be reprogrammed to their normal state. Graph theory is a powerful gift of mathematics which allows us to understand complex networks.In this study, graph theory was utilized for quantitative analysis of the epigenetic network of hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) and subsequently finding out the important vertices in the network thus obtained. Secondly, this network was utilized to locate novel targets for hepato-cellular carcinoma epigenetic therapy.The vertices represent the genes involved in the epigenetic mechanism of HCC. Topological parameters like clustering coefficient, eccentricity, degree, etc. have been evaluated for the assessment of the essentiality of the node in the epigenetic network.The top ten novel epigenetic target genes involved in HCC reported in this study are cdk6, cdk4, cdkn2a, smad7, smad3, ccnd1, e2f1, sf3b1, ctnnb1, and tgfb1.&#169; 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",

Here we show that autophagy supports mTORC1 hyperactivation in NSCs lacking Tsc1, thereby promoting defects in NSC maintenance, differentiation, tumourigenesis, and the formation of the neurodevelopmental lesion of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Analysing mice that lack Tsc1 and the essential autophagy gene Fip200 in NSCs we find that TSC-deficient cells require autophagy to maintain mTORC1 hyperactivation under energy stress conditions, likely to provide lipids via lipophagy to serve as an alternative energy source for OXPHOS. In vivo, inhibition of lipophagy or its downstream catabolic pathway reverses defective phenotypes caused by Tsc1-null NSCs and reduces tumorigenesis in mouse models. These results reveal a cooperative function of selective autophagy in coupling energy availability with TSC pathogenesis and suggest a potential new therapeutic strategy to treat TSC patients.",

        "abstract": "In both monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) patients, immune functions are variably impaired, and there is a high risk of bacterial infections. Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes and constitute the first line of host defense. Since little is known about the contribution of autophagy in the neutrophil function of MGUS and MM patients, we investigated the basal autophagy flux in freshly sorted neutrophils of patients and tested the plastic response of healthy neutrophils to soluble factors of MM. In freshly sorted high-density neutrophils obtained from patients with MGUS and MM or healthy subjects, we found a progressive autophagy trigger associated with soluble factors circulating in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, associated with increased IFN&#947; and pSTAT3S727. In normal high-density neutrophils, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, a morphological characteristic of autophagy, could be induced after exposure for three hours with myeloma conditioned media or MM sera, an effect associated with increased phosphorylation of STAT3-pS727 and reverted by treatment with pan-JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Taken together, our data suggest that soluble factors in MM can trigger contemporary JAK2 signaling and autophagy in neutrophils, targetable with ruxolitinib.",

The primary endpoint was morbidity and mortality in this group of patients; the secondary endpoint was overall survival.A systematic search strategy was used to browse through Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a combination of standardized index terms. Studies published between 1997 and 2017 were selected. Only those studies that showed morbidity and mortality after digestive and hepatobiliary tract oncological surgery in individuals aged 80 years and older were included. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42018087921. PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were applied.A total of 79 studies were included, categorized by origin of malignancy: esophageal (7), stomach (26), liver (4), pancreas (19), and colorectal (23). Compared with the non-elderly group, the elderly group had similar esophageal morbidity with higher mortality (RR 2.51, 1.50 to 4.21; P&#160;=&#160;0.0005); higher gastric morbidity (RR 1.25, 1.09 to 1.43; P&#160;=&#160;0.001), and mortality (RR 2.51, 1.81 to 3.49; P&#160;=&#160;0.0001); similar liver morbidity and mortality; higher pancreatic morbidity (RR 1.17, 1.03 to 1.33; P&#160;=&#160;0.02) and mortality (RR 2.37, 1.86 to 3.03; P&#160;<&#160;0.00001); and similar colorectal morbidity with higher mortality (RR 4.44, 1.91 to 10.32; P&#160;=&#160;0.005).Oncological surgery of most abdominal visceral tumors is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients older than 80 years.Copyright &#169; 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Those with a PCI &#8804; 15 and primary malignancy of gastrointestinal origin were then selected for subgroup analysis. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors impacting postoperative outcomes.Demographic data did not significantly differ between open (n&#160;=&#160;24) and minimally invasive (n&#160;=&#160;9) groups. The MI group had a mean age of 57.34&#160;&#177;&#160;14.92, BMI of 27.03&#160;&#177;&#160;4.27, Charlson comorbidity score of 1.78&#160;&#177;&#160;1.72, and PCI of 5.56&#160;&#177;&#160;5.08. Mean time to flatus (days) was 2.78 in the MI group and 5.04 in the open group (p&#160;<&#160;0.001), and mean length of IV analgesic use (days) was 3.11 in the MI group compared to 6.00 in the open group (p&#160;=&#160;0.006).

The objectives were to compare feasibility, complication data, and survival of patients under and upper the age of 70 who are managed for endometrial cancer by robot-assisted laparoscopy.This is a retrospective comparative single-center study including patients treated between January 2007 and December 2016. Patients were divided into 2 groups: less than 70 years and greater than or equal to 70 years. The primary endpoint was the rate of complications. The secondary endpoints were conversion rate and follow-up.148 patients were included: 86 under 70 (group A) and 62 aged 70 and over (group B). More adhesiolysis was performed in group B (p&#160;<&#160;.01); the pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection rates were not different between both groups (p&#160;=&#160;.2 and p&#160;=&#160;.9).

The tumors were endometrioid adenocarcinomas for 77.9 and 66.7% respectively (p&#160;=&#160;.2), with grade 3 tumors more represented in older patients (24.4% vs. 48.4%, p&#160;<&#160;.01). There were more tumors at high risk of recurrence after 70 years (33.7 vs. 45.2%, p&#160;=&#160;.04). No significant difference was found for postoperative complications. There was no difference in overall survival (p&#160;=&#160;.7) or progression-free survival (p&#160;=&#160;.2). Undertreated women rate was similar in both groups (p&#160;=&#160;.1).Robotic surgery appears feasible and reproducible and could bring a benefit and allow optimal surgery without increasing the morbidity in the management of endometrial cancers whatever the age is.Copyright &#169; 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Treatment of liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma is surgical resection. However, only 10-15% of the patients in this context will be candidate for curative resection arising other 10-13% after response to neoadyuvant chemotherapy. In order to perform the liver metastases surgery, it is necessary to have a sufficient remnant liver volume (RLV) which allows maintaining an optimal liver function after resection. Studies on liver regeneration have determined that CD133&#160;+&#160;stem cells are involved in liver hypertrophy developed after an hepatectomy with encouraging results. As presented in previous studies, CD133&#160;+&#160;stem cells can be selected from peripheral blood after stimulation with G-CSF, being able to obtain a large number of them. We propose to treat patients who do not meet criteria for liver metastases surgery because of insufficient RLV (<40%) with CD133&#160;+&#160;cells together with portal embolization, in order to achieve enough liver volume which avoids liver failure./Design: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative PVE plus the administration of CD133&#160;+&#160;mobilized from peripheral blood with G-CSF compared to PVE only. SECONDARY AIMS ARE: to compare the grade of hypertrophy, speed and changes in liver function, anatomopathological study of hypertrophied liver, to determine the safety of the treatment and analysis of postoperative morbidity and surveillance.Prospective randomized longitudinal phase IIb clinical trial, open, to evaluate the efficacy of portal embolization (PVE) together with the administration of CD133&#160;+&#160;cells obtained from peripheral blood versus PVE alone, in patients with hepatic metastasis of colorectal carcinoma (CCRHM).The number of CD133&#160;+&#160;obtained from peripheral blood after G -CSF stimulation will be far greater than the number obtained with direct puncture of bone marrow. This will allow a greater intrahepatic infusion, which could have a direct impact on achieving a larger and quicker hypertrophy. Consequently, it will permit the treatment of a larger number of patients with an increase on their survival.ClinicalTrials.gov, ID NCT03803241.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. For cancers detected at an advanced stage or intraperitoneal relapse, the prognosis is poor. Optimal cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the most accepted treatment; however, patients with advanced intraperitoneal disease might benefit from hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The aim of this study was to analyze recurrence-free survival (RFS) after CRS and HIPEC in a large series of patients with peritoneal metastases from endometrial cancer.Patients with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer with primary or recurrent peritoneal dissemination were included. All patients underwent CRS plus HIPEC. Data were prospectively collected in the Spanish Group of Peritoneal Oncological Surgery (GECOP) database.Forty-three patients with endometrial cancer and peritoneal metastasis were included. Fifteen patients (35%) were diagnosed with G3 endometrioid carcinomas and 28 (65%) with other non-endometroid histologies. A completeness of cytoreduction score of CC-0 was achieved in 41 patients (95%). RFS at 5 years was 23%, being factors related to worse RFS: treatment with preoperative chemotherapy (p&#160;=&#160;0.027), resection of more than three peritoneal areas (p&#160;=&#160;0.010), cytoreduction of the upper abdominal space (p&#160;=&#160;0.023), HIPEC treatment with paclitaxel (p&#160;= 0.013), and the presence of metastatic lymph nodes (p&#160;= 0.029).Better RFS rates after CRS and HIPEC were observed for patients with the following characteristics: cytoreductive surgery without preoperative chemotherapy, complete surgery performed with limited surgical maneuvers, treated with cisplatin, and no lymph node metastases.Endometrial cancer has a poor prognosis when diagnosed at advance stage. Patients with intraperitoneal metastases from endometrial cancer may benefit from CRS plus HIPEC with improvement in the recurrence-free survival results.Copyright &#169; 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Stain normalization is a crucial pre-processing step for histopathological image processing, and can help improve the accuracy of downstream tasks such as segmentation and classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of stain normalization methods, various metrics based on color-perceptual similarity and stain color evaluation have been proposed. However, there still exists a huge gap between metric evaluation and human perception, given the limited explainability power of existing metrics and inability to combine color and semantic information efficiently. Inspired by the effectiveness of deep neural networks in evaluating perceptual similarity of natural images, in this paper, we propose TriNet-P, a color-perceptual similarity metric for whole slide images, based on deep metric embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach using four publicly available breast cancer histological datasets. The benefit of our approach is its representation efficiency of the perceptual factors associated with H&E stained images with minimal human intervention. We show that our metric can capture the semantic similarities, both at subject (patient) and laboratory levels, and leads to better performance in image retrieval and clustering tasks.",

        "abstract": "Whole-slide imaging (WSI) is the digitization of conventional glass slides. Automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on WSI enables digital pathology and the integration of pathology with other data like genomic biomarkers. Numerous computational algorithms have been developed for WSI, with most of them taking the image patches cropped from the highest resolution as the input. However, these models exploit only the local information within each patch and lost the connections between the neighboring patches, which may contain important context information. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale convolutional network (ConvNet) to utilize the built-in image pyramids of WSI. For the concentric image patches cropped at the same location of different resolution levels, we hypothesize the extra input images from lower magnifications will provide context information to enhance the prediction of patch images. We build corresponding ConvNets for feature representation and then combine the extracted features by 1) late fusion: concatenation or averaging the feature vectors before performing classification, 2) early fusion: merge the ConvNet feature maps. We have applied the multi-scale networks to a benchmark breast cancer WSI dataset. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our multiscale networks utilizing the WSI image pyramids can achieve higher accuracy for the classification of breast cancer. The late fusion method by taking the average of feature vectors reaches the highest accuracy (81.50%), which is promising for the application of multi-scale analysis of WSI.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 20&#160;years, there has been increasing interest in the use of Bayesian statistical methods for the analysis of clinical trials used to support regulatory decisions. Bayesian methods for the analysis of clinical trials are an attractive option when good prior information is available. Yet, in many cases, prior information is scarce and only tentative or proprietary prior information exists. In these situations, it is necessary to use noninformative type or skeptical-type priors.We undertook a systematic study of Bayesian methods and applied them to 13 randomized clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for registrational purposes. Across all 13 studies, there were a total of 10,521 patients using 10 experimental agents.Our results demonstrated that Bayesian analyses with noninformative priors provided similar results to more traditional analyses. We also found that early interim looks at the study results can vary widely based upon the type of prior used. Finally, we found that pre-defined threshold stopping rules need to be relatively strong to prevent trials from stopping very early.Our results suggest that, when prior information is limited and a noninformative prior is used, there is little numerical difference between Bayesian methods and more traditional analysis methods. Bayesian methods, however, may provide additional summaries of the data that are more easily interpretable than means and confidence intervals.",

The group created consisted of dense and non-dense breast types equally and included approximately similar percentages of benign and malignant breast mass sizes. Finally, 70 subjects were included: 30 females with definite malign, 20 with definite benign breast masses, and 20 without any breast pathology based on mammography and ultrasonography results, who were considered as the control group. Three experienced Radiologists (R1, R2, R3) who were not aware of the final diagnosis evaluated all images independently. Radiologist performance was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interobserver reliability values were estimated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis.The diagnostic accuracy suitability of CT according to BI-RADS scores for R1, R2 and R3 were found as p <0.001, p <0.001 and p <0.001, respectively.

Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox Proportional Hazard model of 9258 OCSCC patients from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) database treated with surgery from 2003 to 2009. Potential predictors of OS were age, gender, race, tobacco use, oral cancer sub-sites, pathologic tumor stage and grade, pathologic nodal stage, extra-capsular invasion, clinical levels IV and V involvement, and adjuvant treatment selection. Weighted propensity scores for treatment were used to balance observed baseline characteristics between three treatment groups in order to reduce bias. Following primary surgery, patients underwent observation (56%), radiation alone (31%) or chemoradiation (13%). All tested predictors were statistically significant and included in our final nomogram. Most important predictor of OS was age, followed by pathologic tumor stage. SEER based-survival nomogram for OCSCC patients differs from published models derived from patients treated in a single or few academic treatment centers. An unexpected finding of patient age being the best OS predictor suggests that this factor may be more critical for the outcome than previously anticipated.&#169; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2019.",

Thymic epithelial neoplasms were classified as low-risk thymomas (A, AB, B1), high-risk thymomas (B2, B3), and thymic carcinomas. All lesions were evaluated together and divided into two groups as benign and malignant, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography parameters of the two groups were compared.Histopathological examination identified 29 thymic epithelial neoplasms (13 low-risk, 14 high-risk, two thymic carcinomas), 13 benign lesions, and 15 malignant lesions. No significant correlation was identified between the positron emission tomography/computed tomography parameters and histological subtype of thymic epithelial neoplasms. There was no significant difference in the maximum and mean standardized uptake values, metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis, and mean Hounsfield units of the lesions between low-risk and high-risk thymic carcinomas. The maximum and mean standardized uptake values, metabolic tumor volume, and mean Hounsfield units of the lesions were significantly higher in the malignant group than in the benign group.Our study results show that positron emission tomography/ computed tomography is useful in the differentiation of benign and malignant anterior mediastinal masses, although it fails to differentiate between the histological subtypes of thymic epithelial neoplasms.Copyright &#169; 2020, Turkish Society of Cardiovascular Surgery.",

However, early diagnosis of CRC metastases offers a chance of long-term survival in as much as 40% of patients after curative treatment. Current guidelines are based on clinical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing, computed tomography scanning, and endoscopic surveillance. Although CEA is the most widely used laboratory test, it has very low sensitivity (30-40%). Moreover, there is no evidence to support the association of CEA testing with improved survival or quality of life. Thus, novel markers with greater specificity and sensitivity are needed. The aim of this review was to define the role of available laboratory markers in early diagnosis of metastatic CRC. We identified novel tests with the highest association to metastatic CRC: circulating tumour DNA, growth/differentiation factor 15, and &#946;6-integrin. We also discuss other promising markers, although most of the studies are preliminary and require validation.Copyright: &#169; 2020 Termedia Sp. z o. o.",

        "abstract": "Existing methodology for the design of Phase I-II studies has been intended to search for the optimal regimen, based on a trade-off between toxicity and efficacy, from a set of regimens comprised of doses of a new agent. The underlying assumptions guiding allocation are that the dose-toxicity curve is monotonically increasing, and that the dose-efficacy curve either plateaus or decreases beyond an intermediate dose. This article considers the problem of designing Phase I-II studies that violate these assumptions for both outcomes. The motivating application studies regimens that are not defined by doses of a new agent, but rather a peptide vaccine plus novel adjuvants for the treatment of melanoma. All doses of each adjuvant are fixed, and the regimens vary by the number and selection of adjuvants. This structure produces regimen-toxicity curves that are partially ordered, and regimen-efficacy curves that may deviate from a plateau or unimodal shape. Application of a Bayesian model-based design is described in determining the optimal biologic regimen, based on bivariate binary measures of toxicity and biologic activity. A simulation study of the design's operating characteristics is conducted, and its versatility in handling other Phase I-II problems is discussed.",

This article aimed to present the epidemiological features, treatment and prognostic factors of thyroid lymphomas by retrospectively reviewing 4 patients with thyroid lymphoma. Four patients were treated for primary thyroid lymphoma, two of whom were women and two were men, with a mean age of 63.7 (51-74) years. Common complaint of those patients was the sudden swelling of the neck. Two patients were diagnosed with fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and the other two patients were diagnosed with surgical excision. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were applied to all four patients. While one patient died in the second year of follow-up, the other three patients are still being followed.

Patients with at least 1 histopathologically proven polyp were included in this study.A total of 12.563 endoscopic procedures of the upper gastrointestinal system were investigated and 353 (2.8%) polypoid lesions were detected. Mean age of these patients was 56.3 years and 241 (68.3%) of the patients were female. Gastric polyps were found most commonly in the antrum (50.1%) and of all gastric polyps, 245 (69.5%) were less than 1 cm. Histopathological evaluation showed that hyperplastic polyp (HP) (n= 151, 42.8%) was the most common polyp type, followed by fundic gastric polyp (FGP) (n= 51, 14.4%). Non-polyp gastric mucosa evaluation of 298 patients revealed that 34.9% of the cases were Helicobacter pylori positive, 19.4% had intestinal metaplasia, and 11.4% had atrophic gastritis.Polyps of the upper gastrointestinal system are generally detected coincidentally as they have no specific symptoms. Polypectomy is required for gastric polyps because of their potential for malign transformation according to medical evidence.Copyright &#169; 2019, Turkish Surgical Society.",

We reviewed data based on admission and discharge code status.Of 88 patients who met inclusion criteria, 6 (7%) were do not resuscitate (DNR) on admission (aDNR). Do not resuscitate on admission patients were significantly older than those who were full code on admission (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference between admission code status and sex, marital status, active cancer, premorbid mRS, admission Glasgow Coma scale (GCS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, or bleed severity. At discharge, 66 (75%) patients were full code (dFULL), 11 (13%) were DNR (dDNR), and 11 (13%) were comfort care. African American and Hispanic patients were significantly more likely to be dFULL than Asian or white patients (P = .01) and less likely to be seen by palliative care (P = .004). Patients with less aggressive code status had higher median APACHE II scores (P = .008) and were more likely to have active cancer (P = .06). There was no significant difference between discharge code status and sex, age, marital status, premorbid mRS, discharge GCS, or bleed severity.Limitation of code status after nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage appears to be associated with older age, white race, worse APACHE II score, and active cancer.

We also evaluated the impact of PCC on patient care by examining its association with prespecified secondary outcomes of code status amendment to do not resuscitate (DNR), discharge disposition, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission rate, length of stay, and place of death.Ninety (36% female) patients with HGGs were identified. Palliative care consultation was obtained in 16 (18%) patients. Palliative care consultation was associated with a greater odds of code status amendment to DNR (odds ratio [OR]: 18.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.01-65.73), which remained significant after adjustment for confounders (OR: 27.20, 95% CI: 5.49-134.84), a greater odds of discharge to hospice (OR: 24.93, 95% CI: 6.48-95.88), and 30-day mortality (OR: 6.40, 95% CI: 1.96-20.94).In this retrospective study of patients with HGGs admitted to a university-based NICU, PCC was seen in a minority of the sample.

It covers six themes with an emphasis on methodological issues. (1) Our health-related behavior varies across geographic settings, so should public health policy. (2) Facilities (supply) and patients (demand) in a health care market interact with each other across geopolitical borders, and measures of health care accessibility need to capture that. (3) Our health outcome is the result of joint effects of individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics, and an adequate definition of neighborhood is critical for assessing neighborhood effect. (4) Disease rates in areas of small population are unreliable, and one effective way to mitigate the problem is to construct a larger, internally-homogenous and comparable area unit. (5) Defining a scientific geographic unit for health care market is critical for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to evaluate health care delivery, and GIS enables us to define the unit (e.g., primary care service areas, hospital service areas, and cancer service areas) automatically, efficiently and optimally. (6) Aside from various optimization objectives around \"efficiency\", it is as important to plan the location and allocation of health care resources toward maximum equality in health care access.

New high cut-off (HCO) techniques remove free light chains more effectively than conventional dialysis. In some cases, this technique may turn out better than hemodiafiltration. However, there are some differences between specific techniques in the removal of kappa and lambda light chains. Lambda light chains are better removed by polymethyl methacrylate membranes with a change of filter during dialysis. Kappa light chains are thoroughly removed by polymethyl methacrylate membranes and HCO (35,000 Da) polysulfone membranes. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to differentiate between the effect of HCO dialysis therapy and concomitant chemotherapy because some of the data is not fully conclusive.

MicroRNA-133a-3p (miR-133a-3p) is one of the tumor-related miRNAs that interprets a critical function in the genesis and development of various tumors. This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of miR-133a-3p in RB.Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was used to assess the miR-133a-3p expression in RB tissues and a cell model. MTT assay, western blot, flow cytometry and luciferase reporter assay were performed to evaluate the effect of miR-133a-3p on cell viability, apoptosis and the cell cycle. An RB xenograft model was established to assess the in vivo influence of miR-133a-3p on RB growth.MiR-133a-3p level was reduced in RB tissues and the cell model (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001). Addition of miR-133a-3p reduced cell viability, and increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (p < 0.001). Additionally, CREB1 was identified to be the target of miR-133a-3p in RB cell lines (p < 0.001). Cell viability reduction, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest increases mediated by miR-133a-3p were attenuated by CREB1 overexpression (p < 0.001). MiR-133a-3p inhibited tumor growth of RB in vivo (p < 0.001).Our results reveal that miR-133a-3p exhibits anti-cancer effects by targeting CREB1 in RB.

The study was designed to investigate the role and therapeutic potential of miR-1179 in ovarian cancer.Proliferation rate was monitored by MTT assay. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Cell cycle apoptosis was detected by AO/EB and annexin V/PI staining. Expressions analysis was carried out by qRT-PCR and western blotting. In vivo evaluation was carried out in xenografted mouse models.The results revealed that miR-1179 is considerably upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines. Inhibition of miR-1179 triggers decrease in the viability via initiation of apoptotic cell death of ovarian PA-1 cancer cells. TargetScan analysis showed PTEN to be the main target of miR-1179 in PA-1 cells. Exploration of PTEN expression in ovarian cancer cell lines revealed up to 9-fold downregulation of PTEN. However, inhibition of miR-1179 in PA-1 cells resulted in upregulation of PTEN expression. In addition, overexpression of PTEN caused a reduction of PA-1 cell viability via induction of apoptotic cell death. However, silencing of miR-1179 could rescue the effects of miR-1179 inhibition on the proliferation of miR-1179. The miR-1179 suppression was accompanied by a significant decline in phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT expression in the PA-1 cells. The in vivo study showed that miR-1179 suppression inhibits the xenografted tumor growth.The results of this study indicate that miR-1179 may prove to be an important therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.Copyright &#169; 2019 Termedia & Banach.",

Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma has also raised significant safety concerns in recent years.A systematic search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was performed to identify all cases of breast implant-associated deaths reported to the FDA.The search identified 50 reported cases of apparent implant-related mortality; breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma comprised the majority of fatal outcomes (n = 21, 42%), followed by lymphoma (n = 4, 8%), breast cancer (n = 3, 6%), pancreatic cancer (n = 2, 4%), implant rupture (n = 2, 4%), and postoperative infections (n = 2, 4%). Single cases (n = 1, 2% each) of leukemia, small bowel cancer, lung disease, pneumonia, autoimmune and joint disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, liver failure, and sudden death, and 2 cases (4%) of newborn deaths, to mothers with breast implants, were also identified. A literature review demonstrated that 54% of alleged implant-related deaths were not truly associated with breast implant use: the majority of these reports (82%) originated from the public and third-party sources, rather than evidence-based reports by health-care professionals and journal articles.Although there exists a need for more comprehensive reporting in federal databases, the information available should be considered for a more complete understanding of implant-associated adverse outcomes. With only 46% of FDA-reported implant-related deaths demonstrated to be truly associated with breast implant use, there exists a need for public awareness and education on breast implant safety.Copyright &#169; 2019 The Authors.

Few studies have focused on how to evaluate the extent of rib osteomyelitis for surgical management. A 78-year-old woman who had received radiation therapy after a radical mastectomy due to breast cancer 30 years ago manifested a rib pain and chest skin ulcers. Because chest magnetic resonance imaging failed to visualize osteomyelitis of the rib, a wide-ranged rib resection was initially planned considering her radiation field. An additional imaging, 3-dimensional (3D) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT), was performed to obtain 3D virtual chest images highlighting the areas of inflammatory or necrotic bone tissues; her osteomyelitis was localized in the left anterior chest. A chest wall reconstruction was performed using a vascularized pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap on the left side after the resection of the ribs, part of the sternum, and costal cartilage with radical debridement of all necrotic tissues. The 3D SPECT/CT contributed to a safe chest wall reconstruction with a 40% reduction in resected bone and soft tissues when compared to the magnetic resonance imaging-based surgical plan. Pathology results showed no evidence of inflammation or necrosis in the surgical margin. No complication related to the reconstruction or no recurrence was observed during a postoperative 12-month follow-up. The present case suggested that 3D SPECT/CT can be applied to preoperative surgical planning related to bone diseases including osteomyelitis, traumas, bone tumors, and diabetic foot. The appropriate application of 3D SPECT/CT requires full validation through significant clinical experience.Copyright &#169; 2019 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Biologic and synthetic meshes are used in immediate implant-based breast reconstruction for coverage of the lower pole of the implant. This study aimed to compare outcomes of Veritas with TiLOOP bra (TiLOOP group [TG]).Retrospective study of skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomies in patients who underwent an implant-based reconstruction using either Veritas or TiLOOP bra between January 2014 and December 2016 was performed.Thirty-six reconstructions (22 unilateral, 7 bilateral) using the Veritas mesh and 179 breast reconstructions (61 unilateral, 59 bilateral) using TiLOOP bra were identified. The Veritas group (VG) showed a higher rate of postoperative complications compared with the TG (VG = 54% versus TG = 14%, P < 0.01%), including higher rates of seroma, nonintegration of mesh (VG = 51.4% versus TG = 1.6%, P < 0.01), implant rotation (VG = 16.2% versus TG = 1.6%, P < 0.01), infection (VG = 18.9% versus TG = 2.1%, P < 0.01), and wound breakdown (VG = 10.8% versus TG = 0.5%, P < 0.01). The VG also had a higher rate of major interventions (VG = 35.1% versus TG = 7.8%, P < 0.01) and minor interventions (VG = 18.9% versus TG = 2.2%, P < 0.01) compared with TG, including a higher rate of implant loss and unplanned return to theater.Veritas mesh was associated with a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications compared with TiLOOP bra. Our data strongly question the safety profile of Veritas in implant-based breast reconstruction. Further studies in this area are warranted.Copyright &#169; 2019 The Authors.

        "abstract": "The majority of reported cancer survival statistics in the United States are generated using the National Cancer Institute's publicly available Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, which prior to 2019 represented 28% of the US population (now 37%). In the case of rare cancers or special subpopulations, data sets based on a larger portion of the US population may contribute new insights into these low-incidence cancers. The purpose of this study is to characterize the histology-specific survival patterns for all primary malignant and nonmalignant primary brain tumors in the United States using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR).Survival data were obtained from the NPCR (includes data from 39 state cancer registries, representing 81% of the US population). Relative survival rates (RS) with 95% CI were generated using SEER*Stat 8.3.5 from 2004 to 2014 by behavior, histology, sex, race/ethnicity, and age at diagnosis.Overall, there were 488 314 cases from 2004 to 2014. Overall 5-year RS was 69.8% (95% CI = 69.6%-69.9%). Five-year RS was 35.9% (95% CI = 35.6%-36.1%) for malignant and 90.2% (95% CI = 90.1%-90.4%) for nonmalignant tumors. Pilocytic astrocytoma had the longest 5-year RS (94.2%, 95% CI = 93.6%-94.6%) of all glioma subtypes, whereas glioblastoma had the shortest 5-year RS (6.1%, 95% CI = 6.0%-6.3%). Nonmalignant nerve sheath tumors had the longest 5-year RS (99.3%, 95% CI = 99.1%-99.4%). Younger age and female sex were associated with increased survival for many histologies.Survival after diagnosis with primary brain tumor varies by behavior, histology, and age. Using such a database that includes more than 80% of the US population may represent national survival patterns.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a challenging diagnosis with almost universally poor prognosis. Though the survival advantage of postoperative radiation (RT) is well established, around 90% of patients will fail in the RT field. The high likelihood of local failure suggests the efficacy of RT needs to be improved to improve clinical outcomes. Radiosensitizers are an established method of enhancing RT cell killing through the addition of a pharmaceutical agent. Though the majority of trials using radiosensitizers have historically been unsuccessful, there continues to be interest with a variety of approaches having been employed. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, and a number of other molecularly targeted agents have all been investigated as potential methods of radiosensitization in the temozolomide era. Outcomes have varied both in terms of toxicity and survival, but some agents such as valproic acid and bortezomib have demonstrated promising results. However, reporting of results in phase 2 trials in newly diagnosed GBM have been inconsistent, with no standard in reporting progression-free survival and toxicity. There is a pressing need for investigation of new agents; however, nearly all phase 3 trials of GBM patients of the past 25 years have demonstrated no improvement in outcomes. One proposed explanation for this is the selection of agents lacking sufficient preclinical data and/or based on poorly designed phase 2 trials. Radiosensitization may represent a viable strategy for improving GBM outcomes in newly diagnosed patients, and further investigation using agents with promising phase 2 data is warranted.Published by Oxford University Press 2019.",

Whereas all level 1 evidence to date concerns single-fraction SRS for postoperative brain metastasis, there is emerging evidence that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) may improve local control at the resected tumor bed. The lack of direct comparative data for SRS vs FSRT results in a diversity in clinical practice.

        "abstract": "Primary cardiac sarcoma (PCS) is a deadly disease. The impacts of tumour size on prognosis and surgical outcomes in PCS patients remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the impact of tumour size on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of PCS patients to provide a reference for the surgical treatment.A total of 261 PCS participants enrolled from 1983 to 2016 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Using the X-tile program, we classified the tumour size into 2 subgroups: &#8804; 4.0 cm and > 4.0 cm. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine OS and CSS. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify the independent prognostic impacts of tumour size and surgery in the 2 subgroups (&#8804; 4.0 cm vs >&#160;4.0 cm).With the use of 4.0 cm as a cutoff value, tumour size seemed to be an independent prognostic factor for OS (P&#160;= 0.009) and CSS (P&#160;= 0.014) of PCS patients. Surgery improved the OS (P&#160;= 0.017) and CSS (P&#160;= 0.040) in PCS patients with tumour size > 4.0 cm but not in with tumour size &#8804; 4.0 cm (both P > 0.05).Tumour size of > 4.0 cm is an independent predictor of poor prognosis and is associated with the surgical outcomes in PCS patients. Surgery significantly improves the prognosis in PCS patients with tumour size > 4.0 cm. Our findings have the potential to assist clinicians to better evaluate the prognosis of PCS patients and develop optimal therapeutic strategies.Copyright &#169; 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

        "title": "The Evolving Design of NIH-Funded Cardio-Oncology Studies to Address Cancer Treatment-Related Cardiovascular Toxicity.",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular (CV) toxicity from cancer therapy is a significant and growing concern. Conventional oncology clinical trial designs focused singularly on cancer treatment efficacy have not provided sufficient information on both CV risk factors and outcomes. Similarly, traditional CV trials evaluating standard interventions typically exclude cancer patients, particularly those actively receiving cancer therapy. Neither trial type simultaneously evaluates the balance between CV toxicity and cancer outcomes. However, there is increasing collaboration among oncologists and cardiologists to design new cardio-oncology trials that address this important need. In this review, we detail five ongoing, oncology-based trials with integrated CV endpoints. Key design features include: 1) a careful assessment of baseline risk factors for CV disease; 2) an introduction of cardioprotective interventions at various timepoints in cancer therapy; 3) a balance of the risk of subclinical CV injury with the need for ongoing cancer treatment; and 4) an understanding of the time profile for development of clinically apparent CV toxicity. Additional critical priorities in cardio-oncology clinical research include harmonization of data collection and definitions for all physician- and patient-reported exposures and outcomes.",

Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Acute and subacute toxicities were graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.Median follow-up was 10.5&#160;months (range, 1-27) for all surviving patients. Most were stage III (80%), received median radiation therapy (RT) dose of 60&#160;Gy (range, 45-72), and had concurrent chemotherapy (65%). At baseline, the IMPT cohort was older (76 vs 69&#160;years, P&#160;<&#160;.01), were more likely to be oxygen-dependent (18 vs 2%, P&#160;=&#160;.02), and more often received reirradiation (27 vs 9%, P&#160;=&#160;.04) than their IMRT counterparts. At 1&#160;year, the IMPT and IMRT cohorts had similar overall survival (68 vs 65%, P&#160;=&#160;.87), freedom from distant metastasis (71 vs 68%, P&#160;=&#160;.58), and freedom from locoregional recurrence (86 vs 69%, P&#160;=&#160;.11), respectively. On multivariate analyses, poorer pulmonary function and older age were associated with grade +3 toxicities during and 3&#160;months after RT, respectively (both P&#160;&#8804;&#160;.02). Only 5 (15%) IMPT and 4 (9%) IMRT patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities 3&#160;months after RT (P&#160;=&#160;.47). There was 1 treatment-related death from radiation pneumonitis 6&#160;months after IMRT in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Compared with IMRT, our early experience suggests that IMPT resulted in similar outcomes in a frailer population of LA-NSCLC who were more often being reirradiated. The role of IMPT remains to be defined prospectively.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

The median age at treatment was 68 years (range, 44-78). Most patients were female (62.5%).

        "abstract": "Pulmonary dysfunction is a prevalent and potentially debilitating late effect of pediatric cancer treatment. We postulated that age, as a surrogate for respiratory developmental status, might be associated with vulnerability to pulmonary injury.Sixty-one children treated with lung radiation at our institution who had undergone a pulmonary function test (PFT) between 1995 and 2016 were analyzed. Data collection included age at diagnosis and treatment, radiation dose and location, spirometry, and plethysmography results. PFTs were normalized according to age, sex, height, and ethnicity, and transformed into standardized z-scores. Obstructive disease was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second z score/forced vital capacity z score < -1.645, restrictive as total lung capacity z&#160;score <&#160;-1.645, and abnormal diffusion as diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide z score <&#160;-1.645. We determined the incidence of PFT abnormalities in our population and estimated the relative risk of developing pulmonary abnormalities using models adjusted for age.At a mean age of 24 years (range, 12-31) and time from radiation of 9 years (range, 1-20), the cumulative incidence of any pulmonary abnormality was 34.4%. Among patients with an abnormal PFT, diffusing and restrictive abnormalities were most common (57.1% and 52.4%). When stratified by age at radiation treatment, 66.7% of patients <5 years had a PFT abnormality, compared with 47.6% for aged 5 to 13 and 20.6% for patients >13. Compared with patients >13 years, those <5 years and 5 to 13 years at radiation treatment had a significantly increased risk of an abnormal PFT with an odds ratio of 7.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.17, 51.06) and 3.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.06, 11.57), respectively (P <. 035). Furthermore, this association remained when examining each type of abnormality (P > .05).PFT abnormalities were common among our cohort of childhood cancer survivors treated with lung radiation. Younger age at treatment is associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary dysfunction, presumably owing to developmental immaturity.&#169; 2019 The Authors.",

We evaluated patterns of care and outcomes for SCCC using the National Cancer Database.This retrospective cohort study of SCCC (2004-2011) included 542 cases. Patient demographic, diagnosis, treatment information, and overall survival (OS) were compared with descriptive statistics, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox models. Clinical reasoning was used to select variables for multivariable models to avoid overfitting.SCCC had more comorbidities, higher grade, and advanced stage than other histologies. SCCC received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (36%) more often than squamous cell carcinoma (23%) and adenocarcinoma (13%, P&#160;<&#160;.001). SCCC had worse OS across all stages (P&#160;<&#160;.001). Looking at SCCC alone, patients who received chemoradiation (CRT) (with external beam and brachytherapy) and those who received chemotherapy and surgery (without RT) had similar OS (median OS 44 vs 47&#160;months; P&#160;=&#160;.7) on Kaplan-Meier. Patients receiving CRT were more likely to have stage II or III and N+&#160;disease (P&#160;<&#160;.001).

The cumulative incidences of biochemical recurrence (defined by the Phoenix definition) and physician-scored genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities (defined per the original trials using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) were estimated using a competing risk framework. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between late toxicity and prespecified covariates: biologically effective dose, every other day versus weekly fractionation, intrafractional motion monitoring, and acute toxicity.Median follow-up was 3.1 years (range, 0.5-10.8 years). In addition, 505 (54.8%) patients had low-risk disease, 236 (25.6%) had favorable intermediate-risk disease, and 180 (19.5%) had unfavorable intermediate-risk disease. Intrafractional motion monitoring was performed in 78.0% of patients. The 3-year cumulative incidence of biochemical recurrence was 0.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-1.7%), 2.2% (95% CI, 0-4.3%), and 5.1% (95% CI, 1.0-9.2%) for low-, favorable intermediate-, and unfavorable intermediate-risk disease. Acute grade &#8805;2 GU and GI toxicity occurred in 14.5% and 4.6% of patients, respectively. Three-year cumulative incidence estimates of late grade 2 GU and GI toxicity were 4.1% (95% CI, 2.6-5.5%) and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.5-2.1%), respectively, with late grade &#8805;3 GU and GI toxicity estimates of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.1-1.3%) and 0.4% (95% CI, 0-0.8%), respectively.

They received IFRT at 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. We calculated the percentages of overlap of GTV in the CA and SMA lymph node regions and examined what cases tend to have an overlap. We also investigated the dose metrics of CA and SMA lymph node regions by IFRT and the frequency of CA or SMA lymph node metastasis after IFRT.The median GTV volume was 52.2 mL. Median overlap percentages in the CA and SMA lymph node regions were 39.2% and 28.6%, respectively. There was a significant correlation between GTV volume and SMA overlap percentage (P < .001).

        "title": "IMRT Reduces Acute Toxicity in Patients Treated With Preoperative Chemoradiation for Gastric Cancer.",
        "abstract": "Preoperative chemoradiation is being currently evaluated in 2 randomized international trials. However, chemoradiation for gastric cancer can be associated with relatively high rates of acute toxicity. We compared rates of toxicity, toxicity-related events, and oncologic outcomes in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and those treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT).We retrospectively reviewed records of 202 patients with consecutive gastric cancer treated with preoperative intent radiation therapy at our institution from 1998 to 2018. Patients with gastroesophageal junction involvement and those with metastatic disease were excluded. Eighty-two patients received 3DCRT, and 120 patients received IMRT. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy, and 99% received concurrent chemotherapy.There were no significant differences between the 3DCRT and IMRT groups regarding sex, race, histology, tumor location, histology, or nodal stage. The rate of grade 3 to 4 acute toxicity was significantly lower in patients treated with IMRT compared with 3DCRT (49% vs 70%, P = .004). The composite rate of toxicity-related events (hospitalization, feeding tube use, intravenous rehydration, or radiation therapy breaks) was also significantly lower in patients treated with IMRT compared with 3DCRT (56% vs 85%, P <.001). In addition, 68% of patients who received IMRT and 73% of patients who received 3DCRT underwent subsequent surgical resection (P = .245). Among patients who underwent surgery, the 3-year overall survival rates were not significantly different between those treated with IMRT and 3DCRT (71% vs 69%, P&#160;= .786). Patients receiving IMRT had a significantly higher absolute nadir lymphocyte count compared with patients receiving 3DCRT (median, 0.21 vs 0.16 K/UL; P = .047).Our study suggests that IMRT might significantly reduce rates of grade 3 to 4 acute toxicity and toxicity-related events compared with 3DCRT, with no significant difference in oncologic outcomes. IMRT is an appropriate and possibly preferable radiation modality in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation for gastric cancer.&#169; 2019 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "The role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone for patients with &#8805;5 brain metastases is not fully understood. The objective of the study was to compare SRS-alone treatment results for 2 to 4 versus 5 to 15 tumors.This was an institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study using our prospectively accumulated database including 1150 patients with 2 to 4 tumors and 939 with 5 to 15 tumors who underwent Gamma Knife SRS during a 20-year period (1998-2018). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine post-SRS survival times, and competing risk analyses were applied to estimate cumulative incidences of the secondary endpoints.The post-SRS median survival time was slightly longer in the group with 2 to 4 tumors (8.1 months) than in that with 5 to 15 tumors (7.2 months, P = .0010). Median survival time differences were statistically significant for non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal tract cancer, and others but not for small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and kidney cancer. Multivariable analysis demonstrated female sex, better Karnofsky Performance Status score, non-small cell lung cancer (vs gastrointestinal tract cancer), younger age, controlled primary cancer, and no extracerebral metastases to be significant predictors of a longer survival period in both tumor number groups. Crude and cumulative incidences of salvage whole brain radiation therapy were significantly higher in the group with 5 to 15 tumors than in that with 2 to 4 tumors, although those of other secondary endpoints were similar to or lower in the 5 to 15 tumor number group than those in the group with 2 to 4 tumors.We conclude that carefully selected patients with &#8805;5 to 15 tumors are not unfavorable candidates for SRS alone.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Brain metastases (BrM) are common in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRm) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We sought to determine the rate of neurologic death (ND) in this population.We analyzed data from 198 patients who received a diagnosis of BrM from EGFRm NSCLC between 2004 and 2016, comparing patients whose initial treatment for BrM was stereotactic radiosurgery with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with or without TKI, or TKI alone. The incidence of ND was determined using a competing risks analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify clinical variables associated with this outcome.The percentage of patients who initially received stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation therapy, or TKI alone was 22%, 61%, and 17%, respectively. Median overall survival in these subgroups was 31.1, 14.6, and 24.6 months, respectively (P = .0016). The 5-year incidence of ND among all patients was 40% and did not significantly vary according to treatment group. In a multivariable model, only leptomeningeal disease at any point in a patient's disease course significantly correlated with ND (hazard ratio 4.75, P <.001).Among our cohort of patients with BrM from EGFRm NSCLC, the incidence of ND was significantly higher than suggested by previous reports. BrM should be considered a driver of mortality in many patients with EGFRm NSCLC, and treatments providing better control of BrM, lower neurocognitive side effects, and maintenance of quality of life are needed.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "We examined whether female authorship, traditionally underrepresented in the radiation oncology (RO) literature, has improved during the past decade, and whether the introduction of double-blind peer review (where reviewers are blinded to author names and vice-versa) improved female authorship rates.We analyzed authorship lists during a 10-year period (2007-2016) from the 2 highest impact-factor RO journals: The International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (IJROBP) and Radiotherapy and Oncology (R&O). From each journal, 20 articles per year were randomly selected. Gender trends of the first, second, last, and collaborating authors (defined as all other positions), were analyzed. A one-sample proportion test was used to compare US female senior authorship (2012-2016) with the 2015 benchmark for female US academic radiation oncologists (30.6%).Across 400 articles, the mean &#177; standard deviation percentage of female authors was 30.9% &#177; 22.0% with 34.8% of first, 36.7% of second, and 25.4% of last authors being female. The total percentage of female authors per year increased from 2007 to 2016 (P = .005), with no significant increase in the percentage of first (P = .250), second (P = .063), or last (P = .213) female authors. Double-blind peer review was associated with an increase in the mean percentage of female authors (2007-2011: 27.4% vs 2012-2016: 34.0%; P = .012). The proportion of US female senior authors in the latter period (27.6%) and the proportion of female US academic radiation oncologists (30.6%) were not significantly different (P = .570).Although the percentage of female authors in RO has increased during the past decade, this did not correspond to a higher representation of women in high-profile authorship positions. Introduction of double-blind peer review was associated with a rise in female authorship. The proportion of female US senior authors and academic radiation oncologists is similar, suggesting that senior authorship rates are approaching appropriate levels in the United States.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

These plans are informed by the changing landscape of health care delivery, technologic advancements affecting radiation therapy care, patient desire for care closer to home, and expected increases in utilization of radiation therapy services. In this article, we describe the development, model, and final recommendations of CCO's fifth radiation therapy capital investment strategy.A panel of multidisciplinary provincial experts, in combination with 2 patient and family advisors, developed planning principles to guide the development of a patient-centered strategy. Adaption of the previously used model for radiation therapy planning was used.The development of the capital investment strategy took place from fall 2017 to fall 2018. The model included 3 main factors: patient demand (including utilization targets), machine throughput, and machine demand and supply. The final recommendation is for an investment of 26&#160;new radiation therapy machines in the province by&#160;2028.The strategy plans for continued province-wide access to quality radiation therapy care and ensures machines are added to the system at the right place and in the right time. Ongoing data collection throughout this period is necessary to ensure the strategy achieves its goals and to allow for planning of future strategies.&#169; 2020 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "Protein neddylation is a post-translational modification which transfers the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to a lysine residue of the target substrate through a three-step enzymatic cascade. The best-known substrates of neddylation are cullin family proteins, which are the core component of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). Given that cullin neddylation is required for CRL activity, and CRLs control the turn-over of a variety of key signal proteins and are often abnormally activated in cancers, targeting neddylation becomes a promising approach for discovery of novel anti-cancer therapeutics. In the past decade, we have witnessed significant progress in the field of protein neddylation from preclinical target validation, to drug screening, then to the clinical trials of neddylation inhibitors. In this review, we first briefly introduced the nature of protein neddylation and the regulation of neddylation cascade, followed by a summary of all reported chemical inhibitors of neddylation enzymes. We then discussed the structure-based targeting of protein-protein interaction in neddylation cascade, and finally the available approaches for the discovery of new neddylation inhibitors. This review will provide a focused, up-to-date and yet comprehensive overview on the discovery effort of neddylation inhibitors.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

However, owing to the heterogeneity of tumors and individual immune systems, PD-L1/PD-1 blockade still shows slow response rates in controlling malignancies in many patients. Accumulating evidence has shown that an effective response to anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 therapy requires establishing an integrated immune cycle. Damage in any step of the immune cycle is one of the most important causes of immunotherapy failure. Impairments in the immune cycle can be restored by epigenetic modification, including reprogramming the environment of tumor-associated immunity, eliciting an immune response by increasing the presentation of tumor antigens, and by regulating T cell trafficking and reactivation. Thus, a rational combination of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade and epigenetic agents may offer great potential to retrain the immune system and to improve clinical outcomes of checkpoint blockade therapy.&#169; 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

We aimed to understand these findings by identifying the issues described in qualitative survey feedback and suggest how care may be improved.We reviewed 2699 qualitative comments made to open questions about what was good or might be improved about National Health Service care between 2010 and 2014. We identified 84 (3%) specific comments about general practice care and used open coding and framework analysis to develop a thematic framework.We identified 3 key themes and 12 subthemes: first, the experience of initial diagnosis by a general practitioner (GP), including apparent complexity of making the diagnosis, apparent slowness in referral for investigation, referral made by patient or family, delay in receiving scan results, and whether the GP quickly identified the problem and referred to a specialist; second, the experience of care and support from the general practice, including lack of supportive response from the GP, lack of follow-up care from the GP, lack of family involvement by the GP, lack of GP knowledge about management, and whether the GP responded in a supportive way to the diagnosis; and third, the experience of overall coordination in care, including lack of communication between the hospital and general practice and good communication about the care plan.Qualitative responses from patients with brain cancer reveal their needs for better emotional and practical support within primary care. Suggestions include increasing the speed of initial referral for investigation, the depth of discussion about diagnostic difficulties, and developing coordinated care plans with cancer centers.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "At present, there exists a wide range of diagnostic tests available in the diagnosis of Diverticular Disease. This can give rise to significant regional variability in practice between clinical centres; as well as locally between different patient cohorts. The choice of test used may depend on a variety of both clinical and non-clinical factors, including: symptoms at time of presentation, co-morbidity, clinical setting (primary or secondary care; routine or urgent indication), patient preference and tolerability, safety, cost, local clinical expertise, and availability. Diverticular disease will often, for example, be diagnosed following the investigation of patient symptoms such as a change in bowel habit or rectal bleeding. In such instances, luminal endoscopy (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) is already established as the most sensitive test to exclude other important clinical conditions including colitis or colorectal cancer. Equally, however, in patients who are frail and/or acutely unwell, especially if there is significant medical co-morbidity, non-invasive investigations such as CT may be preferred. This is particularly the case where the diagnostic test may need to allow for complications such as abscess formation or perforation to be excluded at the same time. It is the aim of these guidelines to clarify the most accurate, cost effective and appropriate test to be used for a patient presenting with symptoms or signs suggestive of possible Diverticular Disease. It may be that in some clinical settings a number of different tests are appropriate, in which case the individual risks and benefits of each test should be explained to the patient.Copyright &#169; NICE 2019.",

Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n&#8239;=&#8239;40) or a control group (n&#8239;=&#8239;40). All participants were administered a demographic questionnaire and an Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS) pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 1, 2, and 3 months following the intervention. The control group completed the assessments along the same time line as the intervention group. Women in the experimental group were provided three sessions of a psychological individual intervention which included psychoeducation regarding their diagnosis and personalized intervention strategies to improve their overall sexual satisfaction with sexual intercourse. Each intervention took between 60 and 90&#8239;min to administer.The experimental and control group participants were well balanced in terms of demographic characteristics and sexual satisfaction scores before the intervention. The intervention group showed a positive increasing trend in the sexual satisfaction scores over time while the control group participants had a negative trend (p&#8239;<&#8239;0.05). There were also statistical differences in the sexual satisfaction scores at each follow-up month (p&#8239;<&#8239;0.05) adjusted for the baseline score and relevant demographical variables, showing longer term effects with a significant increase in sexual satisfaction over time.Providing a psychoeducational based intervention provided an increase of sexual satisfaction during intercourse for women diagnosed with breast cancer. The psychoeducation based intervention provided an opportunity for participants to dispel common myths regarding their disease and obtain new strategies and skills to improve their sexual satisfaction from intercourse with their partners.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in patients with locally-invasive tumors, an aggressive surgical attempt may result in unnecessary morbidity. Neoadjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibition has been utilized to downstage tumors prior to surgical excision but its role in thyroid cancer treatment is not well-established. We describe the potential role that lenvatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may have as a neoadjuvant agent in advanced locoregional medullary thyroid carcinoma.Our patient presented with a large left thyroid mass and bulky left lateral neck lymphadenopathy. Imaging studies revealed a hypervascular and locally-invasive tumor with metastatic central and left lateral lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy cytologic evaluation and plasma calcitonin concentration of 32,926 pg/mL were consistent with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Rearranged during transfection germline mutation testing was negative. A multidisciplinary team of physicians deemed the patient a poor surgical candidate and recommended 4 months of neoadjuvant lenvatinib therapy to reduce tumor burden with a subsequent reassessment of resectability. Given the tumor's hypervascularity, lenvatinib was chosen due its potent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition, as well as its availability at our institution.Lenvatinib therapy resulted in rapid regression of tumor volume (approximately 70% reduction) as documented by computed tomography and ultrasound. Surgery after 4 months of treatment resulted in a 99% reduction in serum calcitonin and imaging studies 6 months later showed no residual disease.Lenvatinib has potential as a neoadjuvant agent in advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma, and permitted tumor resection in this previously inoperable patient.Copyright &#169; 2020 AACE.",

Materials can be used as instructive delivery vehicles to achieve accumulation of drugs in the lymph nodes and to target specific lymph node-resident cell subtypes.

The purpose of this study is to validate the use of methylene blue dye alone for SLNB in early breast cancer patients. 60 patients of early breast cancer were randomized to receive either methylene blue alone (Group A-30 patients) or a combination of both methylene blue and radioactive colloid (Group B-30 patients) for detection of sentinel lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was done followed by complete axillary dissection in all patients. In both Groups A and B, sentinel node was identified in all 30 patients, giving identification rate of 100%. In group A, sentinel node was the only positive node in 1 patient, with a false-positive rate of 14.2%. The negative predictive value was 91.3%. The sensitivity of the procedure in predicting further axillary disease was 75% with a specificity of 95.45%. The overall accuracy was 90%. In group B, sentinel node was the only positive node in 2 cases, giving a false-positive rate of 28.7%. The negative predictive value was 95.65%. The sensitivity of the procedure in predicting further axillary disease was 83.33% with a specificity of 91.67%. The overall accuracy was 90%. Although the false-negative rate was slightly higher with methylene blue alone than that using combination (8.6%-4.3%), it was statistically insignificant. Similarly the sensitivity (75%-83.33%), specificity (95.45-91.67%), and negative predictive value (91.3%-95.67%) were also comparable between groups A and B, respectively. Negative predictive value and false-negative rates are comparable, whether blue dye is used alone or a combination of blue dye and radioactive colloid is used. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with blue dye alone is reliable and can be put to clinical practice more widely, even if nuclear medicine facilities are not available in resource constrained centers, so as to reduce long-term morbidity of axillary dissection, with similar oncological outcomes.&#169; Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2019.",

In the context of oncological reconstruction with radial forearm flap, the patient-reported outcomes of donor site morbidity amongst Indian patients have not been reported previously. Cultural and racial differences prevent extrapolation of morbidity data from Western literature. We aimed to evaluate subjectively the subjective long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes of the RAFF donor site. Patients who underwent RAFF reconstruction for intra-oral defects between 2014 and 2016 were included. Two questionnaires (Cosmesis and Sensibility and Forearm Disability) were administered. Fifty-two patients who completed a 2-year follow-up were identified. Thirty-five patients (67%) had complaints regarding the donor site. With regard to cosmesis and sensibility, hand numbness was seen in 21 (40.4%) patients. With regard to forearm disability, a problem in lifting heavy weights was seen in 22 (42.3%) patients. Only three patients in the entire cohort had complaints regarding the cosmesis of the forearm scar. Overall disability score was low (7.83). With regard to donor site morbidity, numbness and difficulty in lifting weights was the most common complaint. There is good acceptance of the donor site and scar with minimum morbidity. These findings are useful for the preoperative counselling of the patients. This is the first Indian study evaluating the long-term subjective outcomes of the radial forearm donor site. We believe the RAFF is still the most preferred flap for oral reconstruction.&#169; Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2019.",

The four acrylates evaluated are chemicals with a high production volume that are produced worldwide. Methyl acrylate is used in the production of acrylic fibres and fire-retardant fabrics. Ethyl acrylate is one of the principal monomers used worldwide in the production of styrene-based polymers, which can be used for medical and dental items. Ethyl acrylate is also used in surface coatings for textiles, paper, leather, and food contact materials, and as a food flavouring agent. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate is used as a plasticizing co-monomer in the production of resins for pressure-sensitive adhesives, latex paints, reactive diluent/cross-linking agents, textile and leather finishes, and coatings for paper. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate, available as a technical-grade product that also contains incomplete reaction products, is used primarily in production of ultraviolet-curable inks, paint additives, coatings, and adhesives.  &#946;-Picoline, a methyl pyridine, is widely used as a starting material for pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos) and pharmaceuticals (e.g. vitamin B3). It is also used as a flavouring substance in foods and beverages. Isobutyl nitrite is used an intermediate in the syntheses of solvents and fuels, and exposures also occur through its use as a recreational drug.  Exposure to all six agents considered may occur in the general population as well as in various occupational settings.

The development of postoperative sleep disturbance is multifactorial and involves the surgical inflammatory response, the severity of surgical trauma, pain, anxiety, the use of anesthetics and environmental factors such as nocturnal noise and light levels. Many of these factors can be managed perioperatively to minimize the deleterious impact on sleep. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies for postoperative sleep disturbance include dexmedetomidine, zolpidem, melatonin, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol and controlling of environmental noise and light levels.

Systems biology aims to reveal therapeutic targets associated with a variety of facets in an individual's tumor, such as genetic heterogeneity and its evolution, cancer cell-autonomous phenotypes, and microenvironmental signaling. These disparate characteristics can be reconciled using mathematical modeling that incorporates concepts from ecology and evolution. This provides an opportunity to predict tumor growth and response to therapy, to tailor patient-specific approaches in real time or even prospectively. Importantly, as data regarding patient tumors is often available from only limited time points during treatment, systems-based approaches can address this limitation by interpolating longitudinal events within a principled framework.

Thyroid cancer in children is a rare disease; however, since 2011, many children in Fukushima, Japan, have been diagnosed with it, and the number has shown a steady increase to over 200 cases at present. Some experts have stated that this phenomenon is due to overdiagnosis caused by thyroid ultrasound (US)-based thyroid screening detecting self-limiting thyroid cancer, which will not lead to clinical symptoms in the future. Harm caused by overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is more serious in the young, since it is difficult to perform active surveillance and children diagnosed with cancer are likely to suffer from stigma. Thus, overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the young is not only a health problem but also a problem of human rights. Conflicts of interest among people related to screening programs and some experts with incomplete knowledge on overdiagnosis help to spread misleading opinions together with fear of radiation exposure among residents, which has led to their erroneous understanding of the nature of US-based thyroid screening. Scientific and honest discussions among experts to enhance education of residents and consideration of medical ethics are crucial to prevent the expansion of overdiagnosis.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

Usually, penile carcinoma is located in the penile glans, in approximately half the cases, with the most frequent histological type being squamous cell carcinoma with its microscopic subtypes. A large number of risk factors have been reported for this disease, having a multifactorial etiology, HPV infection being one of the most important factors involved in its appearance. Out of the HPV DNA positive genital cancers HPV-16 is the most frequently found type in men, followed by HPV-18. The evolution of penile cancer includes two independent carcinogenic pathways, related or unrelated to HPV infection.

        "abstract": "Telescripting is a fundamental cotranscriptional gene regulation process that relies on U1 snRNP (U1) to suppress premature 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts, which is necessary for full-length transcription of thousands of protein-coding (pre-mRNAs) and long noncoding (lncRNA) genes. Like U1 role in splicing, telescripting requires U1 snRNA base-pairing with nascent transcripts. Inhibition of U1 base-pairing with U1 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (U1 AMO) mimics widespread PCPA from cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in human tissues, including PCPA in introns and last exons' 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs). U1 telescripting-PCPA balance changes generate diverse RNAs depending on where in a gene it occurs. Long genes are highly U1-telescripting-dependent because of PASs in introns compared to short genes. Enrichment of cell cycle control, differentiation, and developmental functions in long genes, compared to housekeeping and acute cell stress response genes in short genes, reveals a gene size-function relationship in mammalian genomes. This polarization increased in metazoan evolution by previously unexplained intron expansion, suggesting that U1 telescripting could shift global gene expression priorities. We show that that modulating U1 availability can profoundly alter cell phenotype, such as cancer cell migration and invasion, underscoring the critical role of U1 homeostasis and suggesting it as a potential target for therapies. We describe a complex of U1 with cleavage and polyadenylation factors that silences PASs in introns and 3' UTR, which gives insights into U1 telescripting mechanism and transcription elongation regulation.&#169; 2019 Di et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",

We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy (SVR12) of salvage therapy in these patients.Patients who failed initial DAAs (01/2015-01/2018) were analyzed. Resistance-associated substitutions to NS5A and NS3 were investigated by population sequencing.Of 164 patients enrolled, 16 (10%) experienced treatment failure. Of these, 11 patients received salvage therapy. The majority (91%) were men; 55% had genotype 1a, 45% had cirrhosis, and 45% had hepatocellular carcinoma. Four patients failed the first salvage therapy, and two of them required a second salvage therapy. Overall, 9 of 11 (82%) patients achieved SVR12. All four patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (+/- ribavirin) achieved SVR12. The presence of resistance-associated substitutions did not impact response. Seven patients developed grade 1/2 adverse events. No patient had grade 3/4 adverse events. No patient required interruption of DAA therapy because of clinical or laboratory abnormalities.This is the first prospective study in HCV-infected cancer patients failing DAAs. The efficacy of salvage therapy in this group appears to be lower than previously reported in non-cancer patients, but better response rates are observed with newer regimens. Salvage therapy is associated with minimal toxicity.&#169; 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to determine whether early diagnostic paracentesis (EDP) <12&#8201;h of hospitalization conveys an intermediate-term (6-month) survival benefit in cirrhotic patients diagnosed with SBP.Consecutive US veterans with cirrhosis diagnosed with SBP over 13 years at a single VA medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Kaplan-Meyer analyses assessed the effects of EDP on survival.A total of 79 cirrhotic patients were diagnosed with SBP (61.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8.8 years, n = 77 male, n = 52 [66.8%] Caucasian, n = 23 [29.1%] African-American). Underlying liver diseases included hepatitis c viral infection (HCV) (17.5%), alcohol (28.6%), alcohol and HCV (30.1%), and cryptogenic/metabolic (15.9%). Median baseline model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) was 12 (range 6-34), and median MELD at presentation was 18. Seven subjects had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (11.1%), and 26 (41.3%) presented with sepsis. Thirty-three (52.4%) subjects died within 6 months after the SBP admission. Of the subjects, 41 (65.1%) underwent EDP, of which 23 (56.0%) survived at least 6 months, compared to only 7 of the 22 patients (31.8%) undergoing paracentesis >12&#8201;h from presentation (P = 0.057). The maximal benefit of EDP on survival was observed beyond days 14 and 30; at these time points, no statistical difference in mortality was discernable (P = 0.55 and 0.71). In a multivariate model including age, MELD at admission, hepatocellular cancer, and sepsis criteria, EDP (p 0.034) positively impacted patient survival at 6 months.EDP is associated with improved 6-month mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites. In this veteran cohort, EDP was as important as MELD as a predictor of intermediate-term survival.&#169; 2019 The Authors.

A comparison of the two groups showed both relative youth and diffuse disease distribution to be independent risk factors for progression (P = 0.0034 and 0.0078, respectively). Of the 18 aEE patients whose findings showed progression, 6 developed EoE (5 (17.2%) developed proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-responsive EoE, and only 1 (3.4%) developed PPI-resistant EoE). A comparison of the non-EoE and EoE groups showed relative youth to be an independent risk factor for progression to EoE (P = 0.0146).While some aEE patients developed symptomatic EE, the existence among them of PPI-resistant EoE was extremely rare. Younger age and diffuse disease distribution at first detection in endoscopic findings are risk factors for progression to symptomatic EE in aEE patients.&#169; 2019 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Routine use of water-soluble contrast enema (WSCE) to assess anastomotic integrity is debated. This study aimed to evaluate the role of WSCE to assess anastomotic integrity following anterior resections (AR) with defunctioning stoma prior to reversal and identify factors to limit its selective use.This retrospective study evaluated all WSCE performed over a 7-year period at a high-volume colorectal unit. Risk factors for radiological abnormality/leak, including malignancy, chemoradiotherapy, and immediate postoperative complications, were recorded. A gastrointestinal specialist radiologist and surgeon validated all WSCEs reported as abnormal.Of the 486 WSCE studies identified, 92 were excluded (repeat studies (n =&#8201;51), pediatric cases [n =&#8201;2], no AR [n =&#8201;39]). A total of 394 WSCE studies were evaluated (260 cancer; 134 noncancer patients); 14% (37/260) of cancer patients and 8% (10/134) of noncancer patients had abnormal studies (P =&#8201;0.072). Of the 37 abnormal studies in cancer patients, 73% (27/37) radiological leaks were found, and 41% (n =&#8201;11/27) of these patients had postoperative complications. Of the 10 abnormal studies in noncancer patients, 20% (2/10) radiological leaks were found, but none of these patients had postoperative complications. Overall leak rates were 7% (29/394), and rates were significantly higher in cancer patients than noncancer patients (10 vs 2%, P =&#8201;0.005).Routine use of WSCE may not be necessary prior to reversal. WSCE should be selectively used in event of postoperative leak or complications. Noncancer resections are less likely demonstrate a leak.&#169; 2019 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Standard treatment for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) consists of predniso(lo)ne and azathioprine. However, alternative therapy is required for non- or partial responders and in cases of side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes associated with chloroquine plus prednisone in AIH patients.Fifty-seven patients were recruited to receive either azathioprine or chloroquine, both with prednisone, in a randomized trial. The primary end-point was complete remission, based on normalization of aminotransferase levels in the first 6 months of treatment plus maintenance for at least 18&#8201;months, with minimal or no inflammatory activity in the liver biopsy. Secondary end-points were partial and nonresponse, severe side effects, and treatment withdrawal.There were no differences between groups regarding clinical, serological, histological, and treatment characteristics at baseline. There were no significant differences in the biochemical response rate (67.7 vs 53.8%, P =&#8201;0.41) or the complete remission rate (32.26 vs 15.38%, P =&#8201;0.217). However, despite the long study period, the sample size was smaller than that required for a noninferiority study. The mean prednisone dose was similar in both groups. There was a nonsignificantly higher rate of adverse effects and a tendency toward improvement in glycemic and cholesterol profiles in the chloroquine group (P =&#8201;0.09 and P =&#8201;0.07, respectively).The combination of chloroquine and prednisone exhibited potentially beneficial effects in AIH patients (https://ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02463331).&#169; 2019 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) in South Africa (SA) have been poorly characterized. Black and white SA population groups have demonstrated distinct CRC clinical presentations, suggesting that black SA patients follow a different carcinogenic pathway than their white counterparts. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify unique demographic and histopathological features associated with black SA patients to facilitate earlier diagnosis and to improve disease management.This preliminary descriptive epidemiological study included 665 retrospective CRC cases diagnosed between the period 2011 and 2015 at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Demographic and histopathological features in black versus other race groups (ORG) were compared, and Student's t-test, Chi-square, and Fischer's exact tests were used for statistical analysis.Statistical analysis demonstrated that patients with left-sided tumors of invasive adenocarcinoma were predominantly black and male. These patients were considerably younger when compared to ORG (median 56 vs 62&#8201;years, respectively), P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001. However, no significant propensity for other histological features was illustrated. Polyps were mostly tubular adenomas (51%) and tubulovillous adenomas (TVAs) (44%). TVAs were mostly high-grade lesions (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001) and associated with left-sided CRC (P = 0.0325).These findings verify that black SA CRC patients have an earlier disease onset in comparison to ORG; however, no increased tendency for tumor site, precursor lesion, stage of disease, or gender was evident. Thus, a deeper molecular characterization of CRC is required to understand the underlying causes associated with earlier disease onset in black SA CRC patients.&#169; 2019 The Authors.

In women, melanoma, breast, ovarian, oral cavity, and lung are the most common primary sources; in men, melanoma, lung, colon, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck predominate. The classic presentation of cutaneous metastases is a firm, painless, flesh-colored to an erythematous dermal nodule (or nodules); however, several other presentations, including inflammatory, cicatricial, and bullous lesions, have been reported. Cutaneous metastases may also mimic benign conditions such as lipomas, hemangiomas, or cellulitis. A high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary, and the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy, which may also be used to establish the primary malignancy if unknown, as the histopathologic appearance of the metastatic tissue may mimic the primary tumor. Treatments include excision of the metastases, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, and/or palliative care.Copyright &#169; 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy of the mesothelial cells in the peritoneum. The best-defined risk factor is asbestos exposure, but germline mutations in BAP1 also increase susceptibility to this tumor. The diagnosis of MPM is challenging since clinical manifestations are often nonspecific.We describe a case of MPM in a 53-year-old former construction worker with prior asbestos exposure. The clinical presentation was a 3-month history of dyspeptic complaints. As initial workup, abdominal ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed. Chronic gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori was detected, which was promptly treated but without symptom relief. Abdominal ultrasound showed small volume ascites with hyperechogenic foci, which was later confirmed on computed tomography scan showing the presence of peritoneal nodules in the greater omentum and mesentery. A thorough investigation was conducted based on the suspicion of peritoneal carcinomatosis. A non-peritoneal primary tumor was not found. Ascitic cytology and immunocytochemical studies were suggestive of mesothelioma. He underwent exploratory laparotomy and inoperable peritoneal disease was observed. Peritoneal biopsy confirmed epithelioid-type MPM. Systemic therapy was initiated with platinum plus pemetrexed with good response. The last follow-up was 38 months after the diagnosis.The diagnosis of MPM is challenging since it requires a high degree of suspicion. MPM has a poor prognosis. The standard of treatment recommended is cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. For those who are inoperable, systemic therapy with pemetrexed-cisplatin combination is the alternative. Given the infrequency of disease, it is imperative to ensure patient participation in clinical trials with the purpose of treatment standardization.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "abstract": "Most patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) will develop duodenal polyps and 5% progress to cancer. Those with Spigelman stage IV have a 36% risk of cancer at 10 years. Endoscopic surveillance is necessary with local ablation for early disease. Unresectable duodenal disease and severe dysplasia are an indication for prophylactic radical surgery by pancreaticoduodenectomy or pancreas-sparing duodenectomy. Some preliminary results have shown better outcomes with duodenectomy. A 45-year-old female with FAP had restorative proctocolectomy at 24 years, desmoid of the mesentery with regression after sulindac, two pregnancies, and at the age of 37 years had duodenal polyposis stage III carpeting the periampullary region. Endoscopic papillectomy and extensive piecemeal mucosectomy was performed but was unsuccessful due to recurrence. After 7 years of regular endoscopic surveillance, focal high-grade dysplasia was diagnosed at the last evaluation. Some diminutive polyps were seen in the small-bowel capsule endoscopy. MRCP showed a normal biliary and pancreatic duct without visualization of the Santorini duct. A pancreas and pylorus-preserving duodenectomy was performed with 3 main steps: (1) duodenectomy with preservation of the pancreas and the pylorus; (2) reconstruction with an advanced jejunal limb and duodenojejunostomy; (3) reimplantation of the biliary and pancreatic duct in the jejunal loop. The patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day without complications. In conclusion, pancreas- and pylorus-preserving duodenectomy is a promising alternative to pancreaticoduodenectomy for advanced duodenal polyposis that allows complete endoscopic surveillance.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

        "title": "Nutritional Support of Cancer Patients without Oral Feeding: How to Select the Most Effective Technique?",
        "abstract": "Digestive tumours are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Many cancer patients cannot maintain oral feeding and develop malnutrition. The authors aim to: review the endoscopic, radiologic and surgical techniques for nutritional support in cancer patients; address the strategies for nutritional intervention according to the selected technique; and establish a decision-making algorithm to define the best approach in a specific tumour setting.This is a narrative non-systematic review based on an electronic search through the medical literature using PubMed and UpToDate. The impossibility of maintaining oral feeding is a major cause of malnutrition in head and neck (H&N) cancer, oesophageal tumours and malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Tube feeding, endoscopic stents and gastrojejunostomy are the three main nutritional options. Nasal tubes are indicated for short-term enteral feeding. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the gold standard when enteral nutrition is expected for more than 3-4 weeks, especially in H&N tumour and oesophageal cancer patients undergoing definite chemoradiotherapy. A gastropexy push system may be considered to avoid cancer seeding. Radiologic and surgical gastrostomy are alternatives when an endoscopic approach is not feasible. Postpyloric nutrition is indicated for patients intolerant to gastric feeding and may be achieved through nasoenteric tubes, PEG with jejunal extension, percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy and surgical jejunostomy. Oesophageal and enteric stents are palliative techniques that allow oral feeding and improve quality of life. Surgical or EUS-guided gastrojejunostomy is recommended when enteric stents fail or prolonged survival is expected. Nutritional intervention is dependent on the technique chosen. Institutional protocols and decision algorithms should be developed on a multidisciplinary basis to optimize nutritional care.Gastroenterologists play a central role in the nutritional support of cancer patients performing endoscopic techniques that maintain oral or enteral feeding. The selection of the most effective technique must consider the cancer type, the oncologic therapeutic program, nutritional aims and expected patient survival.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

The database contains treatment information from 9 institutions. Patients included in the database were treated between 2010 and 2014. The survey was conducted in 2018 and current treatment planning methods and prescriptions were queried.Examination of the OOSC database revealed that average doses to critical structures were highly consistent, with the exception of one institution. Survey responses indicated that most centers followed published guidelines regarding dose and prescription point. Dose rate ranged from 51 to 118 cGy/h. As of 2018, most institutions use pre-loaded plaques and fundus photographs and/or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in planning.While there were differences in dosimetric practices, overall agreement in plaque brachytherapy practices was high among OOSC institutions. Clinical margins and planning systems were similar among institutions, while prescription dose, dose rates, and dosimetry varied.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

We investigated the clinical characteristics of CRVO in patients on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition to better understand their predisposing factors and clinical course.This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study (between December 2006 and September 2018). Three of 546 patients enrolled in 46 prospective trials involving treatment with MEK inhibitors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were identified as having CRVO. Clinical examination and course, multimodal ophthalmic imaging, and serum laboratory results (including homocysteine levels and genetic variants of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR]) were reviewed for the 3 affected patients. All 3 patients with MEK inhibitor-associated CRVO had elevated serum homocysteine and gene variants of MTHFR (1 homozygous for A1298C, 1 heterozygous for A1298C, and 1 homozygous for C677T). Following intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF and discontinuation of drug, all patients regained vision to their baseline.MEK inhibitor-associated CRVO is a rare event which can exhibit visual recovery after drug cessation and intravitreous anti-VEGF injections. In this cohort, it was associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and genetic mutations in MTHFR, suggesting a potential role for hyperhomocysteinemia screening prior to initiation of MEK inhibitor therapy.Copyright &#169; 2019 by S.

        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this review was to systematically review and synthesize evidence regarding benefits of using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Data Sources: The data sources were MEDLINE, PubMed, NEJM, Google Scholar, and Google searches of references from relevant and eligible trials. Review Methods: We screened abstracts and full-text articles of identified references for eligibility and reviewed randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and meta-analysis for evidence on benefits of using NSAIDs in CRC treatments. For all extracted data, completeness and relevance were checked. Results: The risk of any adenoma among frequent NSAID users was 26.8% vs 39.9% among placebo subjects who later used NSAIDs sporadically (adjusted relative risk = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.39-0.98; P trend with NSAID use frequency = .03). Long-term use of aspirin reduces the risk of CRC. Aspirin also reduces the incidence of colon adenomas and mortality, especially when used for >10 years. Rofecoxib is associated with the reduction of CRC; however, it was associated with cardiovascular risk (with an overall unadjusted relative risk of 1.50 [95% CI = 0.76-2.94; P = .24]). Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib trial shows that, for patients of all genotypes, the estimated cumulative incidence of one or more adenomas by year 3 was 59.8% for those randomized to placebo as compared with 43.3% for those randomized to low-dose (200 mg, twice daily) celecoxib (relative risk [RR] = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.59-0.79; P < .001) and 36.8% for those randomized to high-dose (400 mg, twice daily) celecoxib and 60.7% in placebo group (RR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.46-0.64; P < .001). Conclusions: The use of COX-2 inhibitors both prior to and after diagnosis of CRC seemed to be mildly associated with the reduction in mortality of patients with CRC. Some literatures state that COX-2 inhibitors might play a synergistic role in adjuvant chemotherapy of FOLFOX regimen. Celecoxib was found to increase the radiosensitization of colon cancer cells.&#169; The Author(s) 2019.",

Difficult endotracheal intubation was reported in 53% of patients. GVL replaced traditional DL in 76% of cases, assisted evaluation prior to traditional DL in 10%, and rescued failed traditional DL in 14%. No complications occurred. Three indications for GVL were identified.GVL was safe in our experience and provides unique benefits in selected scenarios in head and neck surgery.

Rates for 1999-2017 are presented by sex and race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic). Methods-Mortality statistics in this report are based on information from death certificates filed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Cancer deaths are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes C00-C97; heart disease deaths are classified with ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20-I51. Death rates are calculated per 100,000 population. Trends were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute's Joinpoint Regression Program. Results-Cancer death rates for middle-aged adults aged 45-64 declined by 19% from 1999 to 2017 (224.9 deaths per 100,000 to 182.6), whereas heart disease death rates declined by 22% from 1999 (164.3) to 2011 (127.9) and then increased 4% from 2011 to 2017 (133.6). The same trend patterns were observed for both men and women. The cancer death rate was always higher than the heart disease death rate from 1999 to 2017, and was 37% higher in 2017. For non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black men and women, cancer death rates declined over the 1999-2017 period, whereas heart disease death rates declined and then increased since 2009 for non-Hispanic white men and women, and since 2011 for non-Hispanic black men and women. Hispanic men and women experienced different trends than their non-Hispanic white and black counterparts-both cancer and heart disease death rates for this group had periods of decline and stability.All material appearing in this report is in the public domain and may be reproduced or copied without permission; citation as to source, however, is appreciated.",

Methods-Data in this report are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2017. Causes of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death. Results-In 2017, the 10 leading causes of death were, in rank order: Diseases of heart; Malignant neoplasms; Accidents (unintentional injuries); Chronic lower respiratory diseases; Cerebrovascular diseases; Alzheimer disease; Diabetes mellitus; Influenza and pneumonia; Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; and Intentional self-harm (suicide). They accounted for 74% of all deaths occurring in the United States. Differences in the rankings are evident by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Leading causes of infant death for 2017 were, in rank order: Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities; Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified; Newborn affected by maternal complications of pregnancy; Sudden infant death syndrome; Accidents (unintentional injuries); Newborn affected by complications of placenta, cord and membranes; Bacterial sepsis of newborn; Diseases of the circulatory system; Respiratory distress of newborn; and Neonatal hemorrhage. Important variations in the leading causes of infant death are noted for the neonatal and postneonatal periods.All material appearing in this report is in the public domain and may be reproduced or copied without permission; citation as to source, however, is appreciated.",

        "abstract": "Purpose &#8195;Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare head and neck cancer believed to be originated from neural crest cells of the olfactory membrane located in the roof of the nasal fossa. This study evaluates clinical outcomes and failure patterns in ONB patients of those patients treated with surgical resection at a high-volume tertiary cancer center. Methods and Materials &#8195;Thirty-nine ONB patients who underwent surgical resection at our institution from 1996 to 2017 were retrospectively identified. Univariate, multivariate, and survival analysis were calculated using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier log-rank. Results &#8195;Median follow-up time was 59 months (range: 5.2-236 months). The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for the entire cohort were 15 and 7.6 years, respectively. The 5-year cumulative OS and DFS were 83 and 72%, respectively. The 5-year OS for low Hyams grade (LHG) versus high Hyams grade (HHG) was 95 versus 61% ( p &#8201;=&#8201;0.041). LHG was found in 66% of the early Kadish stage patients compared with 28% in the advanced Kadish stage patients ( p &#8201;=&#8201;0.057). On multivariate analysis, HHG and positive node status predicted for worse OS and only HHG predicted for worse DFS. Of note, five patients (all Kadish stage A) who received surgical resection alone had no observed deaths or recurrences with a median follow-up of 44 months (range: 5-235 months). Conclusion &#8195;In this retrospective cohort, patients with positive nodes or HHG have significantly worse clinical outcomes. Future studies should explore treatment intensification for HHG or positive nodes.&#169; Thieme Medical Publishers.",

        "abstract": "Patient-centered care is defined as \"care that is consistent with and respects the values, needs, and wishes of patients\" and is best achieved when clinicians involve patients and their support system in health care discussions and decisions. While this approach has been well established and supported in more general medical specialties, such as primary care, that may encompass a more holistic approach, it has rarely been described in surgical disciplines. Acoustic neuromas (ANs) can be unique among other skull base and intracranial pathologies, in that the management of these tumors can vary from patient to patient depending on various factors. Moreover, typical options, including observation, radiation, and surgery, may often have equipoise for some patients and their tumors. Therefore, a patient-centered approach, strongly guided by the expertise of experienced skull base surgeons, may likely be the most appropriate type of care for patients with ANs. Herein, we review the documented use of patient-centered care in other aspects of medicine, propose the benefits of this approach for patients with ANs, and provide ways this can be better implemented in practice.&#169; Thieme Medical Publishers.",

        "abstract": "As the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and the entire class of organohalogen flame retardants, is declining, the use of organophosphate esters flame retardants (OPFRs) is increasing. In this paper, we ask whether OPFRs are a better choice than PBDEs. To address this question, we compared OPFRs with PBDEs for a wide range of properties. OPFRs exposure is ubiquitous in people and in outdoor and indoor environments, and are now often found at higher levels compared to PBDE peak exposure levels. Furthermore, data from toxicity testing, epidemiological studies, and risk assessments all suggest that there are health concerns at current exposure levels for both halogenated and non-halogenated OPFRs. Obtaining the scientific evidence needed for regulation of OPFRs can take many years. Given the large number of OPFRs in use, manufacturers can move towards healthier and safer products by developing innovative ways to reduce fire hazard for electronics enclosures, upholstered furniture, building materials and other consumer products without adding flame retardant chemicals.",

        "abstract": "This paper tests how the certainty or hypotheticality conveyed through language can be harnessed to enhance the effectiveness of targeted messaging about health risks. We conducted two experiments with adult smokers (n = 317) and middle school youth (n = 321) from low-income communities in the context of pictorial cigarette warning labels. We manipulated hypotheticality of risk through verb modality: 1. non-modal (present tense, e.g., smoking causes cancer), and modal/hypothetical (2. may, 3. can, and 4. will). For adult smokers, definitive (present tense) wording led to greater health risk beliefs, compared to hypothetical wording, among adult males but not females. For youth, contrary to what might seem intuitive, the more hypothetical may verb modality was more effective than the present tense language in promoting health risk beliefs. Among youth, greater health risk beliefs were also associated with reduced susceptibility to use cigarettes. No differences in negative affect by hypotheticality of language were found for either population. We discuss these findings in relation to the theoretical implications for the concept of hypotheticality and the application of construal level theory to strategic health communication.",

        "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of a treatment in phase II clinical trial for cancer study, an adaptive multi-stage design, especially a two-stage one, is commonly used. This type of design allows an on-going study to end early for the participant's safety and design's efficiency. Since a large value of the response rate p for the treatment is wanted, lower one-sided confidence intervals for p are of interest. Due to the limited sample size, exact intervals with a guaranteed confidence level are derived using a rank function that is based on the Clopper-Pearson lower confidence limit. When the sample size in stage 2 is a constant, two kinds of smallest intervals are constructed with or without using the sufficiency principle. The proposed intervals outperform the existing exact intervals, and the intervals not based on minimal sufficient statistic are recommended for practice due to their small expected lengths. When the sample size in stage 2 varies, the smallest interval is also proposed.",

The function of over a thousand genes is reported as affected by genetic modifications in breast cancer.To study the gene expression of Epithelial Membrane 2 (EMP2) and &#946;1-Integrin genes in patients with breast cancer.This study was carried out by cooperation between the Biochemistry Division Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University. This study included 120 subjects divided into 2 groups Group I: Included 60 women with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy. Tissue specimens were taken from the cancerous breast tissue and from the marginal healthy breast tissues. Group II: Included 60 age and sex-matched apparently healthy women served as a control group. All patients participants were subjected to full history taking, general clinical examination, abdominal ultrasound, CT-scan for abdomen, mammography, fine needle biopsy, histopathological examination, immunostaining of tissues, metastatic work up (chest x-ray and bone scan) and laboratory investigations including: Complete blood count (patients and controls), serum carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (patients and controls), detection of EMP2 and &#946;1-Integrin genes expression in the tissue samples by formation of cDNA by reverse transcription PCR after RNA extraction and real-time PCR using SYBR Green technique.Compared to healthy tissues, the breast cancer tissues had significant higher EMP2 and &#946;1-Integringene expression levels. Also, there was a significant increase in CA15-3 in patients group as compared with the control group. It was found that EMP2 and &#946;1-Integrin expression in malignant tissue samples correlates with advanced and metastatic disease.The gene expression of EMP2 and &#946;1-Integrin are important markers for the severity of breast cancer and they are good indicators of its prognosis.&#169; 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Hematological malignancies remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide despite advances in cancer therapeutics. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of&#160;Paramyxoviridae&#160;that elicits considerable interest as an anticancer agent because it can replicate up to 10&#160;000 times faster in human cancer cells than in most normal cancer cells. Several NDV strains reportedly induce the cytolysis of cancerous cell lines. The attenuated Iraqi strain (AMHA1) of NDV is a novel oncolytic agent with promising antitumor characteristics, including apoptosis induction. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the AMHA1 NDV strain to induce apoptotic cell death in hematological tumors through caspase-dependent or independent apoptotic pathways. The cytolytic effects of AMHA1 NDV strains of different multiplicity of infection (MOIs) (20, 15,10, 5, 3, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 )and exposure for all hematological malignancy cell lines (human non-Hodgkin lymphoma SR and human multiple myeloma (COLO 677) and human monocytic leukemia THP1) have been determined through a microtetrazolium (MTT) assay. Propidium iodide and acridine orange (AO/PI) double staining were used to examine the ability of attenuated NDV strain to induce apoptosis in infected cells under a fluorescence microscope and to quantify the percentage of apoptosis induction. Quantitative immunocytochemistry assay was further used to study the caspase-dependent and independent protein expression levels in infected and control cells. Cells treated with NDV strains showed a higher cell-death percentage than untreated cells as quantified by the MTT assay. AO/PI results revealed that NDV exerted a powerful and significant effect on apoptosis induction (P<0.0001) in the human cancer cell lines tested in comparison with control cells. Immunocytochemistry in AMHA1 NDV- infected&#160;human&#160;hematological cell lines revealed a remarkable increase in the expression of caspase 8, 9 (dependent pathway), apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G (independent pathway) in comparison with untreated cells. This study demonstrated the role of the Iraqi NDV strain in inducing apoptosis through dependent and independent pathways in cancer cells and thus its high potential as an antitumor agent.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. Chemotherapy is one of the main methods of breast cancer treatment, but this method is increasingly affected due to drug resistance. One of the newly discovered factors associated with drug resistance in cancer cells is interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IRAK1 inhibition and sensitivity to methotrexate (MTX). Effects of various concentrations of MTX and constant concentration (1&#956;g/ml) of IRAK1/4 inhibitor was examined on MCF-7, BT-20, BT-549, MB-468 cell lines. Cell viability was examined by water soluble tetrazole -1, and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. The expression of IRAK1 and BCRP genes was also assessed by real-time PCR method. IRAK1 inhibitor decreased&#160;IC50&#160;in all examined cell lines, but the most prominent&#160;effect was observed in MB-468. 72 h incubation of cell lines with IRAK inhibitor and MTX, significantly increased the annexin-V and annexin-V/7AAD positive cells, suggesting an apoptotic effect of IRAK on all examined breast cancer cell lines. RT-qPCR test results showed that the IRAK inhibitor had no effect on the expression of BCRP at any time. Our results showed that IRAK inhibitor can increase the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cell lines without effect on BCRP mRNA expression. IRAK inhibitor in combination with MTX can induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines.",

        "abstract": "The constantly rising number of skin malignancies and increasing cancer awareness encourage more people to visit outpatient clinics in order to have various skin lesions removed. Despite the fact that scarring is a physiological response to any excision procedure, minimizing the size of it is a goal of every good practitioner. Therefore the question arises whether different techniques used to remove skin lesions may impact the formation and quality of skin scars.To perform an evaluation of skin scars formed by laser and surgical incisions and their influence on lymphatic outflow in rats.Five male rats were used. Using methylene blue, the migration of dye through lymphatic channels of the lower extremity was measured. Afterwards, transverse incisions were made distally using laser and a surgical blade. Wounds were left to heal by secondary intention. After 4 weeks dye migration assessment was repeated and tissue samples were obtained for microscopic evaluation.Wounds after surgical incisions healed entirely. Wounds after laser treatment had not healed, with a visible area of granulation tissue and hair loss. Significantly worse dye migration was observed in rat extremities after laser therapy than after surgical incision (p = 0.007).The results of the study show that the size of the scar can depend on the incision technique used. Larger scars after laser therapy limit the lymphatic flow of the skin, which may have an adverse effect on mapping sentinel lymph nodes. However, this hypothesis requires further research.Copyright: &#169; 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.",

        "abstract": "There are many papers in the available literature on the pre-operative evaluation of malignant melanoma (MM) using a 20 MHz probe. In many Western European countries, this examination is standard in the diagnosis of such lesions in terms of the resection margin. However, few papers describe and compare the results of melanoma thickness measurements using 20 and 50 MHz frequency probes.The aim of the study was to evaluate the thickness of melanoma using 20 and 50 MHz probes. In addition, the obtained values were evaluated in comparison to the thickness values obtained in the histopathological examination.Melanoma malignum was confirmed histopathologically in 19 out of 72 patients. Then only those 19 patients were enrolled in the study.A correlation was demonstrated between the thickness of the melanoma measured with the 20 and 50 MHz probes, expressed in mm, and the thickness obtained in the histopathological examination expressed in millimeters (Breslow's scale). It was 0.759 (p < 0.001) and 0.734 (p < 0.001), respectively. The average thickness of melanomas obtained in ultrasound examination was identical for both probes and was 0.74 mm.It seems that both types of probes can be used to assess melanoma thickness. The demonstrated correlation of high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) thickness with Breslow's scale indicates that the HFUS evaluation can be used in determination of melanoma resection margins as a repeatable, painless, non-invasive test.Copyright: &#169; 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.",

        "abstract": "Discovering gene-treatment interactions in clinical trials is of rising interest in the era of precision medicine. Nonparametric statistical learning methods such as trees and random forests are useful tools for building prediction rules. In this article, we introduce trees and random forests to the recently proposed case-only approach for discovering gene-treatment interactions and estimating marker-specific treatment effects for a dichotomous trial endpoints. The motivational example is a case-control genetic association study in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), which tested the hypothesis whether finasteride can prevent prostate cancer. We compare this novel approach to the interaction tree method previously proposed. Because of the modeling simplicity - directly targeting at interaction - and the statistical efficiency of the case-only approach, case-only trees and random forests yield more accurate prediction of heterogeneous treatment effects and better measure of variable importance, relative to the interaction tree method which uses data from both cases and controls. Application of the proposed case-only trees and random forests to the PCPT study yielded a discovery of genotypes that may influence the prevention effect of finasteride.",

Patient demographics, echocardiographic findings, investigations, pericardiocentesis procedural details and clinical progress were tracked using a comprehensive electronic medical records system.Of 149 patients who underwent pericardiocentesis, malignancy (46.3%) was the most common cause of pericardial effusions, followed by iatrogenic postsurgical complications (17.4%). 77.3% of effusions were large and 69.8% demonstrated tamponade physiology. Pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography and fluoroscopy was successful in 99.3% of patients and had a complication rate of 2.0%. Likelihood of effusion recurrence and survival to discharge was determined by the aetiology of the pericardial effusion. 24.6% of malignant effusions recurred, and the survival rate 12 months after drainage of a malignant pericardial effusion was 45.0%. Short-term mortality was highest among patients presenting with tamponade due to acute aortic syndromes and those with myocardial rupture due to ischaemic heart disease.Cancer and iatrogenic complications were the most common causes of pericardial effusion in this large cohort of Singapore patients. Pericardiocentesis has a high success rate and relatively low complication rate.

The latter can resolve and count isotopic labels in metabolites and can identify isotopic enrichment in substructures when operated in tandem MS mode. However, MS2 is difficult to implement with chromatography-based UHR-MS due to lengthy MS1 acquisition time that is required to obtain the molecular isotopologue count, which is further exacerbated by the numerous isotopologue source ions to fragment.

Five randomized immune-oncology checkpoint inhibitor trials are ongoing. We assessed the effect of stage, grade, and histologic type on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in candidates for 1 of the 4 North American ongoing immune-oncology checkpoint inhibitor trials of high-risk nmRCC.From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2001-2015), we identified patients who had undergone surgery for nmRCC and had met the inclusion criteria for the PROSPER RCC (nivolumab in treating patients with localized kidney cancer undergoing nephrectomy), CheckMate 914 (a study comparing the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus placebo in participants with localized renal cell carcinoma), KEYNOTE-564 [safety and efficacy study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as monotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of renal cell carcinoma post nephrectomy], or IMmotion010 [a study of atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy in participants with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at high risk of developing metastasis following nephrectomy] trials. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the 10-year CSM rates in the overall cohort according to stage, grade, and histologic characteristics, and in 4 generated random samples according to the eligible patients for each of the 4 trials.Of 116,750 patients who had undergone surgery for nmRCC, 18,559 (15.9%) had fulfilled the inclusion criteria for 1 of the 4 trials. The greatest proportion of higher stage and grade combinations and sarcomatoid histologic features would have qualified for IMmotion010, followed by KEYNOTE-564, CheckMate 914, and PROSPER RCC. Multivariable Cox regression models demonstrated the most unfavorable prognosis for stage N1 grade 3/4 (hazard ratio [HR], 11.5; P&#160;< .001), stage T4N0 grade 3/4 (HR, 9.8; P&#160;< .001), and sarcomatoid histologic features (HR, 5.5; P&#160;<&#160;.001). Among the 4 random samples, the difference in the qualifying criteria resulted in the greatest versus progressively lower CSM rates in the IMmotion010, KEYNOTE-564, CheckMate 914, and PROSPER RCC trials, respectively (P&#160;< .001).Our findings indicate that participation in adjuvant immunotherapy trials should be predominantly encouraged for patients with high-grade stage T3, T4, and N1 and patients with any stage with sarcomatoid pathologic features.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Outcomes after 40.0 months of median follow-up are discussed.Eligible patients had received&#160;&#8805; 1 line of treatment and were&#160;administered bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20 mg) for 8 cycles with or without daratumumab (16&#160;mg/kg) until disease progression.Of 498 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (D-Vd, n&#160;= 251; Vd, n&#160;= 247), 47% had 1 prior line of treatment (1PL; D-Vd, n&#160;= 122; Vd, n&#160;= 113). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly prolonged with D-Vd versus Vd in the ITT population (16.7 vs. 7.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.40; P&#160;<&#160;.0001) and the 1PL subgroup (27.0 vs. 7.9 months; HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.15-0.32; P&#160;< .0001). In lenalidomide-refractory patients, the median PFS was 7.8 versus 4.9 months (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.68; P&#160;= .0002) for D-Vd (n&#160;= 60) versus Vd (n&#160;= 81). Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rates (10-5) were greater with D-Vd versus Vd (ITT: 14% vs. 2%; 1PL: 20% vs. 3%; both P&#160;<&#160;.0001). PFS2 was significantly prolonged with D-Vd versus Vd (ITT: HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.61; 1PL: HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.24-0.51; P&#160;< .0001). No new safety concerns were observed.After 3 years, D-Vd maintained significant benefits in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with a consistent safety profile. D-Vd provided the greatest benefit at first relapse and increased MRD-negativity rates.Copyright &#169; 2019 Janssen Global Services, LLC. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC) is a highly fatal malignancy. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting survival in patients with metastatic and non-metastatic ESCC.Between 2008 and 2016, 107 patients with ESCC who were followed up in an oncology clinic were included in the analysis. Patients were grouped based on the stage of disease as clinical-stage II to IV.Of the 107 patients, 55 (55.1%) of them were male and 52 (48.6%) of them were female. The mean age was 60.8 years. Based on the clinical-stage, 28 (26.2%) patients had stage II disease, 33 (30.8%) had stage III disease, and 46 (43.0%) had stage IV disease. Twenty-nine (27.1%) patients with the non-metastatic disease underwent surgery following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), while 29 (27.1%) patients received definitive CRT. Twenty-six (56.5%) patients with metastatic disease received chemotherapy (CT). While median overall survival (mOS) could not be reached in patients who underwent surgery following neoadjuvant CRT, mOS for patients receiving definitive CRT versus patients treated with surgery alone-was 22.0 months and 24.0 months, respectively (p=0.008). In the metastatic stage, mOS was 8.0 months for the patients treated with a first-line CT and 3.0 months for patients receiving best supportive care (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, factors predicting survival in patients with the non-metastatic disease were ECOG PS 3-4 (Hazard ratio [HR], 6.13), undergoing surgery (HR, 0.22), clinical-stage III disease (HR, 3.19), and presence of recurrence (HR, 24.12). For patients with metastatic disease, ECOG PS 3-4 (HR, 3.31), grade-III histology (HR, 3.39), liver metastasis (HR, 2.53), and receiving CT (HR, 0.15) were the factors associated with survival in multivariate analysis.In our study, surgery and early clinical-stage increased survival, whereas experiencing recurrence adversely affected survival in non-metastatic ESCC. In the metastatic stage, ECOG PS 3-4, grade-3 histology and liver metastasis adversely affected survival, while receiving CT significantly improved survival.Copyright: &#169; 2020 by Istanbul Northern Anatolian Association of Public Hospitals.",

        "abstract": "Chinese migrant women with breast cancer are at risk of poorer psychosocial outcomes. However, little is known about the cancer-related challenges experienced by these women, or how they self-manage their concerns. This qualitative study aims to explore the experience of breast cancer for Chinese-Australian women and gain insight into their coping behaviors.Twenty-four Chinese-Australian women, previously diagnosed with breast cancer, participated in a semi-structured interview or focus group session, conducted in the participant's preferred language. Qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis.Three main themes emerged, reflecting the psychological impact of the diagnosis, the challenges experienced, and the use of social support and other coping behaviors. The theme of psychological impact highlighted the emotional toll of diagnosis and the ongoing anxiety surrounding the fear of cancer recurrence. The theme of challenges identified stressors relating to treatment side effects and the need for psychological support. The social support and coping theme identified the various levels of social support participants received and how Chinese-Australian women may limit their use of social support to protect others. Participants used several behavioral (e.g., diet and exercise) and cognitive (e.g., reframing) strategies to cope with their cancer experience.Chinese-Australian women with breast cancer face significant challenges that impact on their psychological well-being. Varying levels of social support, and the desire to protect others through self-sacrifice, may reflect the cultural expectations of women. The results highlight the need for cultural understanding when developing strategies that optimally support Chinese migrant women with breast cancer.Copyright: &#169; 2019 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

        "title": "An Epigenetics-Based, Lifestyle Medicine-Driven Approach to Stress Management for Primary Patient Care: Implications for Medical Education.",
        "abstract": "Over 75% of patients in the primary care setting present with stress-related complaints. Curiously, patients and health care providers all too often see stress as a relatively benign sequela of many common illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, lung disease, dementia, diabetes, and mental illness. Unfortunately, various day-to-day lifestyle choices and environmental factors, unrelated to the presence of any disease, can cause stress sufficient to contribute to the development of various diseases/disorders and suboptimal health. There is evidence suggesting that counseling in stress management-oriented therapeutic interventions (as offered by lifestyle medicine-oriented practitioners) may prevent or reduce the onset, severity, duration, and/or overall burden of stress-related illnesses. Such counseling often involves considerations such as the patient's nutrition, physical activity, interest in/capacity to meditate, drug abuse/cessation, and so on. Unfortunately, lifestyle medicine-oriented approaches to stress management are rarely offered in primary care-the patient care arena wherein such counseling would likely be best received by patients. Would health care outcomes improve if primary care providers offered counseling in both stress management and positive lifestyle choices? The purpose of this article is to provide both primary care practitioners and educators in health care training programs with an introductory overview of epigenetics. An emerging field of science offering insights into how factors such as stress and lifestyle choices interact with our genes in ways that can both positively and negatively impact the various micro (eg, cellular) through macro (eg, physiologic, pathophysiologic) processes that determine our tendencies toward illness or wellness. A deeper understanding of epigenetics, as provided herein, should enable primary care providers and medical educators to more confidently advocate for the primary benefits associated with counseling in both stress reduction and the pursuit of healthy lifestyle choices.&#169; 2019 The Author(s).",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and control in each set were identified by limma software. The GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment of the DEGs aggregated in the datasets (aggregated DEGs) were analyzed using DAVID and KOBAS 3.0 databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the aggregated DEGs was constructed using STRING database. GSEA software was used to verify the biological process. Association between hub genes and HCC prognosis was analyzed using patients' information from TCGA database by survminer R package.From GSE45267, GSE60502 and GSE74656, 7583, 2349, and 553 DEGs were identified respectively. A total of 221 aggregated DEGs, which were mainly enriched in 109 GO terms and 29 KEGG pathways, were identified. Cell cycle phase, mitotic cell cycle, cell division, nuclear division and mitosis were the most significant GO terms. Metabolic pathways, cell cycle, chemical carcinogenesis, retinol metabolism and fatty acid degradation were the main KEGG pathways. Nine hub genes (TOP2A, NDC80, CDK1, CCNB1, KIF11, BUB1, CCNB2, CCNA2 and TTK) were selected by PPI network and all of them were associated with prognosis of HCC patients.TOP2A, NDC80, CDK1, CCNB1, KIF11, BUB1, CCNB2, CCNA2 and TTK were hub genes in HCC, which may be potential biomarkers of HCC and targets of HCC therapy.&#169; 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",

        "abstract": "Differentiating malignancy from benign diseases is the key to successful management of adnexal masses. Risk of malignancy algorithm (ROMA) has been used for this purpose. We have prospectively studied the diagnostic value of ROMA in patients presented with adnexal masses.We prospective calculated ROMA values prior to surgery for adnexal masses. The risk calculated was then correlated with the histological findings, and results were analyzed according to menopausal status. ROMA cutoff value was determined using ROC curve, and sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated. Statistics were performed on SPSS software (version 20.0).There were 94 patients with adnexal masses included in the study, 65 (69.1%) had epithelial ovarian cancer and 29 (30.9%) were diagnosed benign on histopathology. In both pre- and postmenopausal patients, ROMA values were significantly higher in patients with malignancy compared to those with benign disease (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). ROMA score was of a significant diagnostic value in both premenopausal (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.914, Z&#8201;=&#8201;10.81, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and postmenopausal patients (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.975, Z&#8201;=&#8201;21.51, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). In premenopausal females, ROMA&#8201;>&#8201;13.3% was able to discriminate malignant from benign patients with 97.06% sensitivity and 85.00% specificity. The positive and negative predictive values were 91.7% and 94.4%. Similarly, in postmenopausal females, ROMA value of&#8201;>&#8201;76% achieved 87.10% sensitivity and 100.00% specificity in discriminating malignant from benign patients with 100% positive and 69.2% negative predictive value. The overall accuracy of ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal patients was 87.0% and 85%, respectively.ROMA is a useful and accurate test for differentiating epithelial ovarian cancer from benign ovarian masses. Further studies are needed to compare performance of ROMA with the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI), CA 125 and HE4. Such comparative studies will be helpful to the clinician in deciding the best diagnostic tool for women with adnexal masses.&#169; Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India 2019.",

Three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning has improved treatment efficacy. This retrospective study compares conventional and 3D treatment planning of brachytherapy in patients with cervical cancer and interfraction dose variation to bladder and rectum (D2cc).The mean doses to bladder and rectum (D2cc) were computed by computed tomography (CT)-based planning during 100 sessions of intracavitary brachytherapy for carcinoma cervix with the same source configuration as generated for conventional planning, and these estimates were compared with the doses at International Commission on Radiation Units and measurements (ICRU) rectal, bladder points and point A. Interfraction variation of doses to bladder and rectum during various sessions was also analysed.The mean ICRU bladder dose and D2cc of the bladder for all patients was 3.7&#160;Gy and 7.4&#160;Gy, respectively (p&#160;<&#160;0.001). The mean ICRU rectal dose from conventional plan was 4.3Gy&#160;and with CT planning, 4.45&#160;Gy (p&#160;=&#160;0.04). Interfraction dose variations for D2cc of the bladder were min -5.3&#160;Gy and max 4.8&#160;Gy and those of the rectum were min -1.8&#160;Gy and max 1.72Gy.Dosimetric evaluation of conventional and 3D CT-based treatment planning for the same brachytherapy sessions demonstrated underestimation of ICRU bladder dose points (p&#160;<&#160;0.001) and the rectal ICRU point dose and D2cc (p=0.04). The doses to organs at risk did not show a statistically significant variation between the fractions.

The National Cancer Registry collects data on cancer cases nationwide since 1989 and has reached high quality standards in the last decades. This is the first report on incidence trends.Data from the National Cancer Registry of all new cases of invasive cancer from twelve sites diagnosed in 2002-2015 was analyzed. Age-standardized rates were calculated. Trends of incidence rates were analyzed using joinpoint regression models.For both, men and women, incidence rates trends for all cancer sites, colo-rectal and bladder cancer remained stable. Esophageal and gastric cancers descended while thyroid and kidney cancer incidence increased. In men lung cancer decreased; testicular cancer increased, and prostate cancer increased at the beginning of the period and decreased in the final years. In women, lung cancer increased, breast cancer remained stable and cervical cancer presented a significant decline from 2005 to 2010 and reached a plateau since then.Cancer incidence dynamics are complex and affected not only by Public Health policies such as tobacco control, vaccination and screening programs, but also by environmental and life style changes and the attitude of the medical community towards the application of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The aim of this paper is to analyze cancer incidence time trends in the country and provide possible explanations to them.Copyright &#169; 2019 Universidad del Valle.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process in which cytoplasmic material is recycled under various conditions of cellular stress, preventing cell damage and promoting survival in the event of energy or nutrient shortage, or in response to various cytotoxic insults. Autophagy is also responsible for the removal of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles, playing a vital role in the quality control of proteins and organelles. Impairment of autophagy has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a very interesting process for further research. Recent research highlighted that autophagy is not random and can be selective, making it even more important to understand the molecular mechanisms of selectivity at the organismal level. Drosophila has been demonstrated to be an excellent animal model for studying selective autophagy, as the autophagic machinery is highly conserved, although much is still left to be explored. In this review, an overview of autophagy and its selectivity in Drosophila will be presented.&#169; 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "There is much interest in targeting DNA repair pathways for use in cancer therapy, as the effectiveness of many therapeutic agents relies on their ability to cause damage to DNA, and deficiencies in DSB repair pathways can make cells more sensitive to specific cancer therapies. For example, defects in the double-strand break (DSB) pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR), induce sensitivity to radiation therapy and poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, respectively. However, traditional approaches to inhibit DNA repair through small molecule inhibitors have often been limited by toxicity and poor bioavailability. This review identifies several pharmacologic manipulations that modulate DSB repair by reducing expression of DNA repair factors. A number of pathways have been identified that modulate activity of NHEJ and HDR through this mechanism, including growth and hormonal receptor signaling pathways as well as epigenetic modifiers. We also discuss the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy on DSB repair. Preclinically, these pharmacological manipulations of DNA repair factor expression have been shown to increase sensitivity to specific cancer therapies, including ionizing radiation and PARP inhibitors. When applicable, relevant clinical trials are discussed and areas for future study are identified.&#169; 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Metastasis is the cause of most cancer-related deaths. It is known that breast cancer cells in proximity to macrophages become more invasive in an Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) dependent manner. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are thin, F-actin containing, cellular protrusions that mediate intercellular communication and have been identified in many tumors. The mechanism of TNT formation varies between different cell types. M-Sec (TNFAIP2) has been demonstrated to be involved in TNT formation in some cell types including macrophages. Yet, the requirement of M-Sec in tumor cell TNT formation in response to macrophages has not been explored.The aim of this study was to determine whether EGF was required for macrophage induced tumor cell TNTs in an M-Sec dependent manner and what possible roles tumor cell TNTs play in tumor cell migration and invasion.Macrophage Conditioned Media (CM) was used to induce an increase in TNTs in a number of breast cancer cell lines as measured by live cell microscopy. Tumor cell TNT formation by CM was dependent on the presence of EGF which was sufficient to induce TNT formation. CM treatment enhanced the level of M-Sec identified using western blot analysis. Reduction of endogenous M-Sec levels via shRNA in MTLn3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells inhibited the formation of TNTs. The role of tumor cell TNTs in cell behavior was tested using in vitro transwell and 3D invasion assays. No effect on chemotaxis was detected but 3D invasion was reduced following the knockdown of M-Sec in tumor cell TNTs.Our results show that EGF was necessary and sufficient for tumor cell TNT formation which was dependent on cellular M-Sec levels. While tumor cell TNTs may not play a role in individual cell behaviors like chemotaxis, they may be important in more complex tumor cell behaviors such as 3D invasion.",

However, the dose enhancement considering the biological effectiveness was not shown.The aim of the current study was to evaluate the biological dose-enhancement factor (DbioEF) by the dose rate and to compare the DphysEF and the DbioEF in Lipiodol for liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT).Flattening-filter-free (FFF) 6-MV (6MVX) and 10MVX beams were delivered by TrueBeam. A virtual inhomogeneity phantom and a liver SBRT patient-treatment plan were used. The DphysEF and lineal energy distribution ( y ) distribution was calculated from Monte Carlo simulations. Using a microdosimetric-kinetic (MK) model that is estimated based on the linear-quadratic formula for Lipiodol using human liver hepatocellular cells (HepG2), the biological dose and biological dose enhancement factor (DbioEF) were calculated. The dose rate in the simulation was changed from 0.1 to 24&#160;Gy/min.The DbioEF (DR:2Gy/min) and DphysEF with 10MVX FFF beam were 23.2% and 19.1% at maximum and 12.8% and 11.1% on average in the Lipiodol. In the comparison of the DbioEF between 0.1-24&#160;Gy/min, the DbioEF was 21.2% and 11.1% with 0.1&#160;Gy/min for 6MVX and 10 MVX, respectively. The DbioEF was larger than DEF for the 6MVX and 10MVX FFF beams.

The Lipiodol caused the enhancement of the physical dose and biological effectiveness.The biological dose enhancement (DbioEF) should be considered in the high-density material such as the Lipiodol.&#169; 2019 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.

It usually presents de novo, but is often preceded by Barrett's oesophagus (BO), a premalignant condition whereby the normal squamous epithelium is replaced by columnar lined epithelium with intestinal metaplasia. The main risk factors for BO include male sex, obesity and chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux of acid and bile. The estimated annual risk of BO progression is 0.3%, increasing substantially, up to 30%, when dysplasia is present. Endoscopic surveillance is recommended to detect neoplastic changes at an early stage and considerable evidence supports endoscopic treatment for confirmed low- and high-grade dysplasia, and intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Most OACs are diagnosed at a more advanced stage requiring CT-PET assessment and multi-modal treatment. Surgical treatment is performed in specialist centres, increasingly combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, involving close liaison between members of the multidisciplinary team. Molecular targeted therapies, such as HER2 and VEGFR-inhibitors, are beginning to penetrate clinical practice, but high molecular heterogeneity has impeded progress.

A total number of 50 rats were randomly divided into 10 groups, including controls, rats receiving 0.25 mg/kg (A group), 0.5 mg/kg (B group), 0.75 mg/kg (C group) VCR, 0.25 mg/kg VCR + 0.5 mg/kg saffron (D group), 0.5 mg/kg VCR + 0.5 mg/kg saffron (E group), 0.75 mg/kg VCR + 0.5 mg/kg saffron (F group), 0.25 mg/kg VCR + 1mg/kg saffron (G group), 0.5 mg/kg VCR + 1 mg/kg saffron (H group), and 0.75 mg/kg VCR + 1 mg/kg saffron (I group) groups. Serum level of liver enzymes, including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bilirubin were measured using specific kits at the end of the experimental period. Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) values were measured using ferric reducing antioxidant of power (FRAP) and thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBAR) methods, respectively. Administration of VCR, especially at the concentration of 0.75mg/kg, caused severe hepatic injury with significant increase in the levels of AST (582.0&#177;39.45 UI), ALT (124.0&#177;5.92 UI), ALP (939.8&#177;89.8 UI) enzymes and bilirubin (0.17&#177;0.008). VCR administration also significantly increased the serum MDA level (0.49&#177;0.021 nmol/ml), while TAC value was declined significantly (241.27&#177;18.27 &#956;mol/l). These effects were dose-dependent. Treatment with saffron extract decreased the activity of liver enzymes and MDA values in hepatotoxic rats with a significant enhancement in serum TAC content. These effects were notable for rats that received 1mg/kg plant extract. Administration of saffron, especially at higher concentration, can reduce VCR-induced hepatotoxicity, antioxidant depletion and lipid peroxidation, presumably due to its antioxidative properties.Copyright &#169; 2019 SETOX & Institute of Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology, SASc.",

        "abstract": "Despite current guidelines, a significant increase in the use of core needle biopsy (CNB) has been noted. Our aims were to determine the profile of patients referred for image-guided biopsies, to assess the diagnostic yield of these biopsies, and to learn whether CNB is an effective alternative to surgical excisional biopsy (SEB).All lymph node biopsy samples evaluated in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine from 2014 to 2017 were included. Patients' demographics, biopsy type, and final diagnosis were recorded and classified as diagnostic or nondiagnostic. The reasons for the latter were evaluated and follow-up was obtained, where available.A total of 373 cases, 210 CNB and 163 SEB, were collected. The diagnostic yield was 79% for CNB compared to 97% for SEB. The choice of CNB versus SEB was not dependent on patient's age, gender, or clinical suspicion of malignancy. Failure to reach a diagnosis was due to insufficient or suboptimal tissue in most nondiagnostic CNBs. Lymphoma was equally diagnosed among CNB and SEB. CNB was at an advantage in diagnosing large B-cell lymphomas.When performed adequately, CNB is a good substitute for SEB. Strict and specific guidelines need to be updated and adopted to indicate how and when it can be used, including the recommendation of concomitant complementary diagnostic laboratory testing such as flow cytometry. The latter should be readily available in order to not compromise the quality and accuracy of the diagnoses.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Impaired hematopoiesis morphologically associated with evidence of myelodysplasia manifests clinically with cytopenia/s. Simultaneously, myeloproliferation is seen within the bone marrow and leads to cytosis in the peripheral blood. The diagnostic category of MDS/MPN encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases which share similarities among them, but at the same time have distinct clinical and pathologic features and eventually diverse prognosis; such differences justify their separation in a classification scheme. In the era of genetic and genomic tests, their distinction from conventional myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms still relies on close clinocopathological correlation, with evaluation of both peripheral blood and bone marrow samples being essential in this sense. A multiparametric integration of clinicopathologic data and cytogenetics and molecular genetics results is the preferred diagnostic approach.Copyright &#169; 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We argue that the data favors CMML as the antecedent and causative disease state with a few notable exceptions. Better understanding of this relationship aids clinicians in the education of their patients and in determining the optimal management approach at the bedside.

        "abstract": "In the last version of the WHO classification of myeloid malignancies, flow cytometry and molecular investigation are listed as potentially useful, yet non-essential diagnostic tools in hard-to-recognize chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML). Flow recognition of CMML was initially based on an increase in the fraction of peripheral blood, CD14+,CD16- classical monocytes &#8805;94% of total monocytes. An associated inflammatory disease can preclude the detection of classical monocyte fraction increase by inducing accumulation of CD14+,CD16+ intermediate monocytes. In such a situation, decrease in the Slan+,CD14low,CD16+ non-classical monocyte fraction below 1.7% still supports CMML diagnosis. This robust, two-step flow cytometry assay identifies CMML with a very high sensitivity. Otherwise, detection of one or several acquired gene mutations with high variant allele frequency supports the diagnosis of CMML, oligomonocytic CMML or clonal monocytosis of clinical significance. Together, recent investigations support integration of flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood monocyte subsets and new generation sequencing of a panel of 20-30 recurrently mutated genes in the diagnostic work-up of CMML.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these efforts have been informative, no single model has been considered the consensus for CMML prognostication and all models are only moderately prognostic. CMML clinical models utilize mainly hematology and morphology parameters to estimate risk. A better understanding of cytogenetics and the genomic landscape of CMML have resulted in integrated risk models such as CMML Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS)-Mol and Mayo Molecular that may provide better prognostic accuracy for an individual patient. For example, frameshift/nonsense ASXL1 mutations have been consistently shown to confer inferior outcomes leading to its incorporation into some of the major risk classification systems. Prognostication in the setting of therapeutic interventions such as hypomethylating agents and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation have also garnered considerable interest. Despite having many validated risk models available, not a single system is universally adopted.

Their prognosis is heterogeneous, but several prognostic factors can identify patients with an expected survival of a few years only, including among younger patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Based on the retrospective data available, we discuss how to identify CMML patients for whom curative therapy must be envisaged. We emphasize that, although transplantation remains the only path to cure in CMML, it can be envisaged in only a minority of patients. Despite increased donor availability, its potential remains limited by significant rates of mortality caused both by the procedure and by post-transplantation relapses. We review the options available to bridge patients to transplant, the management of transplantation itself (choice of donor, graft source and condition regimen), and finally the potential for post-transplantation interventions.

The prototypical example is the identification of SF3B1 mutations and its durable association with MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), an entity previously buried within, but now a separate category outside of MDS/MPN-U.

        "title": "Is Breast MRI Better at Finding Second Breast Cancers than Mammograms Alone for Breast Cancer Survivors?",
        "abstract": " Annually, more than 250 000 US women are diagnosed with breast cancer and are recommended for yearly surveillance mammography for second cancers after treatment completion. Many also receive breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without evidence of effectiveness.  (1) Assess patient and provider perspectives on surveillance breast imaging; (2) compare effectiveness of breast MRI with or without mammography to mammography only; (3) develop patient decision aids with education on breast imaging and results from imaging tests.  The research was based within 5 breast imaging registries in the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Using a structured interview guide we conducted 6 focus groups with 41 women who had a personal history of breast cancer. We conducted a systematic literature review, following all relevant standards. We identified 33 938 surveillance mammograms and 2506 breast MRIs from 13 266 women following treatment for stage 0 to III breast cancer diagnosed in 2003-2012; second cancer events were ascertained within 1 year after imaging. We estimated performance measures using end-of-day radiologic assessment and compared them using multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Finally, we developed a prototype, web-based surveillance decision tool with information about breast imaging and results, incorporating women&#8217;s personal characteristics. Women reported anxiety when anticipating surveillance results and discomfort but high trust in imaging. Our systematic review indicated need for robust analyses, including comparative studies in breast imaging. We observed 397 second breast cancers within 1 year of mammogram (286 invasive, 108 ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], 3 unknown) and 44 cancers within 1 year of breast MRI (30 invasive cancers, 13 DCIS, 1 unknown). Unadjusted performance measures comparing breast MRI to mammography only (respectively, per 1000 examinations), were cancer detection rates (within 1 year of exam): 10.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-12.0) vs 8.2 (95% CI, 7.98.5); and interval cancer rates: 6.8 (95% CI, 5.8-7.8) vs 3.5 (95% CI, 3.3-3.7). Sensitivity was 61.4% (95% CI, 46.5-76.2) vs 70.3% (95% CI, 65.8-74.8); specificity was 88.2% (95% CI, 86.9-89.5) vs 88.5% (95% CI, 88.1-88.8); and positive predictive value of cancer among biopsied women was 19.5% (95% CI, 12.3-26.7) vs 30.5% (95% CI, 27.0-34.0). By multivariable logistic regression, breast MRI was associated with improved cancer detection rate (OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.04-2.69; p = 0.03) and specificity (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40; p = 0.02), with no statistically significant difference in sensitivity (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.45-2.72) and a 2.23-fold increased biopsy rate (95% CI, 1.86-2.66).  Women are challenged to understand surveillance breast imaging. Surveillance breast MRI compared with mammography in community practice had 2-fold higher biopsy rates with improved cancer detection, without improvement in sensitivity or a decrease in interval cancer rates. Our promising prototype decision aid provides women and clinicians with information about surveillance imaging. In sum, our results fill a gap about breast imaging for women with a personal history of breast cancer and can facilitate survivorship care planning after a breast cancer diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classification method for analysis of high dimensional data such as genomics data. Recently a number of linear SVM methods have been developed to achieve feature selection through either frequentist regularization or Bayesian shrinkage, but the linear assumption may not be plausible for many real applications. In addition, recent work has demonstrated that incorporating known biological knowledge, such as those from functional genomics, into the statistical analysis of genomic data offers great promise of improved predictive accuracy and feature selection. Such biological knowledge can often be represented by graphs. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge-guided nonlinear Bayesian SVM approach for analysis of high-dimensional data. Our model uses graph information that represents the relationship among the features to guide feature selection. To achieve knowledge-guided feature selection, we assign an Ising prior to the indicators representing inclusion/exclusion of the features in the model. An efficient MCMC algorithm is developed for posterior inference. The performance of our method is evaluated and compared with several penalized linear SVM and the standard kernel SVM method in terms of prediction and feature selection in extensive simulation studies. Also, analyses of genomic data from a cancer study show that our method yields a more accurate prediction model for patient survival and reveals biologically more meaningful results than the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Tobacco smoke from regular cigarettes contains a number of harmful chemicals such as nicotine, arsenic, benzene, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, and tobacco-derived nitrosamines. About 1% of over 7000 chemical substances formed by burning tobacco are identified as the leading causes or possible risk factors of smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and emphysema. The concept of heating tobacco without combustion and smoke has been designed for more than two decades. The products developed with this idea, known as \"Heat-Not-Burn\" tobacco cigarettes, were first introduced in the late 1980s but did not achieve commercial success. However, the tobacco giants have been trying to remarket tobacco heating systems with new technological and modified features for over 10 years. I-Quit-Ordinary-Smoking (iQOS&#174;) is one of the latest heat-not-burn tobacco products, first launched in Japan and Italy. The company then made a submission to the Food and Drug Administration as a modified-risk tobacco product application to sell its own tobacco-heating device iQOS&#174; under its Marlboro&#174; brand in the USA with reduced-risk claims in 2016, but it was rejected. This device is, however, now sold in more than four dozen countries. There are some striking claims that iQOS&#174;, which is described as a novel hybrid product between traditional cigarettes and electronic cigarettes, offers an alternative way to substantially reduce the amount of harmful components compared with traditional cigarettes by its new technology in which tobacco is heated up to 350&#176;C instead of being burnt. It is claimed to produce vapour containing nearly 90% less toxic substances than cigarette smoke and not be a source of second-hand smoking negatively affecting indoor air quality. The purpose of this article is to objectively review the potential effects of iQOS&#174; on human health and the environment by searching and integrating the published research findings.&#169;Copyright 2019 Turk J Pharm Sci, Published by Galenos Publishing House.",

This study was the first to determine the in vitro biological effects of ethanolic extract from the flowering parts of C. solstitialis L. subsp. solstitialis collected from Mu&#287;la Province.The cytotoxic effect was evaluated against Daudi, A549, and HeLa cancer cells and one normal BEAS-2B cell line using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- dipenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Flow cytometric analysis and the caspase-3 activity assay were performed to detect apoptotic cell death. Angiogenic factor [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] secretion and the release of interleukin (IL)-1&#945;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; by cells treated with the extract were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The extract exhibited cytotoxic effects against all the cancer cell lines used but HeLa and Daudi were the most sensitive cells, with IC50 values of 63.18 &#956;g/mL and 69.27 &#956;g/mL, respectively. Selective cytotoxicity was observed between the HeLa and normal BEAS-2B cell lines. The extract arrested the cell cycle at the S and G2 phases. In addition, apoptotic cell death was detected in HeLa and A549 cells. Moreover, the plant extract caused a significant decrease in VEGF secretion in A549 cells and a fluctuation in IL-1&#945;, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; secretion in A549 and Daudi cells.These observations suggest that the flowering parts of C. solstitialis may be a potential source in the development of natural drugs for the treatment of cancer and modulation of cytokine secretion.&#169;Copyright 2019 Turk J Pharm Sci, Published by Galenos Publishing House.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative organism of tuberculosis, which is the most lethal disease after cancer in the current decade. The development of multidrug and broadly drug-resistant strains is making the problem of tuberculosis more and more critical. In the last 40 years, only one molecule has been added to the treatment regimen. Generally, drug design and development programs target proteins whose function is known to be essential to the bacterial cell. M. tuberculosis possesses specialized protein export systems like the SecA2 export pathway and ESX pathways.In the present communication, rational development of an antimycobacterial agent's targeting protein export system was carried out by integrating pocket modeling and virtual analysis.The 23 identified potential lead compounds were synthesized, characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods like infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and further screened for antimycobacterial activity using isoniazid as standard. All the designed compounds showed profound antimycobacterial activity.We found that Q30, M9, M26, U8, and R26 molecules had significant desirable biological activity and specific interactions with Sec of mycobacteria. Further optimization of these leads is necessary for the development of potential antimycobacterial drug candidates with fewer side effects.&#169;Copyright 2019 Turk J Pharm Sci, Published by Galenos Publishing House.",

        "abstract": "Polymeric nanoparticles are a promising novel drug delivery system and have advantages in cancer therapy. Etoposide is an anticancer agent that is used in the treatment of a variety of malignancies. The aim of the present study was to prepare and evaluate novel polymeric nanoparticles containing etoposide.A 32 full factorial design was used to study the effect of Eudragit EPO and Pluronic F-68 on the characterization of nanoparticle suspensions. The polymeric nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation technique. The prepared nanoparticles was evaluated by percentage yield, drug polymer compatibility using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis, drug content, entrapment efficiency, zeta potential, particle size, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, in vitro drug release studies, kinetic modeling, stability studies, and in vivo animal studies. Response surface plots were studied, which were generated using PCP dissolution software.Scanning electron microscopic studies confirmed their porous structure with a number of nanochannels. The FTIR spectra showed the stable character of etoposide in a mixture of polymers and revealed the absence of drug-polymer interactions. The DSC study revealed that the drug was involved in complexation with nanoparticles. The average particle size of etoposide nanoparticles was in the range of 114.4 nm to 136.7 nm. The zeta potential values were attained to ensure good stability of nanosuspensions. In vitro release of the drug from nanoparticles follows the Peppas model and showed controlled release behavior for a period of 24 h. The optimized nanoparticles were subjected to stability studies at 4&#176;C in a refrigerator and the most suitable temperature for storage of etoposide nanoparticles found. The average targeting efficiency of drug-loaded nanoparticles was 41.88&#177;0.030% of the injected dose in the liver, 25.66&#177;0.320% in the spleen 13.82&#177;0.090% in the lungs, 4.52&#177;0.300% in the kidney, and 4.18&#177;0.490% in the brain.Etoposide loaded nanoparticles was found to be effective in sustained release.&#169;Copyright 2019 Turk J Pharm Sci, Published by Galenos Publishing House.",

The effects of the most promising anticancer agents on apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell cycle arrest were determined on a BD FACSAria (I) flow cytometer. Akt activity was measured in the C6 and A549 cell lines using an ELISA colorimetric method. Schr&#246;dinger's Maestro molecular modeling package was used to explore the possible binding modes of compounds 3 and 8 in the active site of Akt enzyme (PDB code: 3OW4).N-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-[(5-((4-nitrophenyl)amino)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio]acetamide (3) and N-(6-nitrobenzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[(5-((4- nitrophenyl)amino)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio]acetamide (8) induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the C6 cell line through inhibition of Akt activity (92.36% and 86.52%, respectively). The docking results of compounds 3 and 8 indicated that &#960;-&#960; interactions, H bonds, and salt-bridge formation were responsible for the observed Akt inhibitory activity.According to in vitro and docking studies, compounds 3 and 8 stand out as promising antiglioma agents.&#169;Copyright 2019 Turk J Pharm Sci, Published by Galenos Publishing House.",

All patients underwent transpalatal excision and variables of interest included age, radiological stage/parameters & tumor size.Objective olfactory dysfunction was seen in 60% while involvement of olfactory strip was suggested in 50%. Despite some marginal trends only noted between size/age with change of olfaction, Pearson's correlation test did not reveal any significance amongst multiple variables. However a better recovery of olfaction following surgery was evident in Category-2 where Chi-Square test (p&#8239;<&#8239;0.05) significantly revealed this to be a function of postoperative duration. This regenerative course in JNA suggests an optimum period of 4&#8239;years for full recovery after surgery.In this first study of olfaction in JNA many new trends have been appreciated. In general, deteriorations of olfaction were seen due to 'vascular-concussion' effect in early postoperative phase where post-surgical clearance of airway showed minimal effect in terms of improvement. The hypervascularity of olfactory epithelium with possible hormonal effects may be responsible for the unique pattern of olfactory function and recovery in JNA.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the emission characteristics of 99 VOCs that daily measured at 10 am in winter from 15 December 2015 to 17 January 2016 and in summer from 21 July to 25 August 2016 in Beijing, the environmental impact and health risk of VOC were assessed. In the winter polluted days, the secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP) of VOC (199.70&#160;&#177;&#160;15.05&#160;&#956;g/m3) was significantly higher than that on other days. And aromatics were the primary contributor (98.03%) to the SOAP during the observation period. Additionally, the result of the ozone formation potential (OFP) showed that ethylene contributed the most to OFP in winter (26.00% and 27.64% on the normal and polluted days). In summer, however, acetaldehyde was the primary contributor to OFP (22.00% and 21.61% on the normal and polluted days). Simultaneously, study showed that hazard ratios and lifetime cancer risk values of acrolein, chloroform, benzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetaldehyde and 1,3-butadiene exceeded the thresholds established by USEPA, thereby presenting a health risk to the residents. Besides, the ratio of toluene-to-benzene indicated that vehicle exhausts were the main source of VOC pollution in Beijing. The ratio of m-/p-xylene-to-ethylbenzene demonstrated that there were more prominent atmospheric photochemical reactions in summer than that in winter. Finally, according to the potential source contribution function (PSCF) results, compared with local pollution sources, the spread of pollution from long-distance VOCs had a greater impact on Beijing.Copyright &#169; 2020.

While nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been associated with most linear GBCAs few, if any, new cases have been verified since the successful implementation of screening programs to detect renal impairment and prevent susceptible patients from receiving these higher-risk agents. The likelihood of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been shown to be negligible with macrocyclic agents, prompting the American College of Radiology and other regulatory agencies to suggest that no screening is necessary when they are used. There is no solid evidence of negative clinical effect from the retention of macrocyclic agents in the brain while there is evidence that they wash out of the brain over time. GBCAs have many important clinical uses that can help prevent morbidity or death. This article reviews the risks and benefits of GBCA administration.Copyright &#169; 2019.

Renal mass CT protocol comprises of a good quality noncontrast, corticomedullary and nephrographic phases, with each phase providing complementary information for diagnosis. Attenuation measurements in different phases are central to the 'golden-rules' in renal mass imaging in the characterization of renal masses. Newer modalities like dual energy CT scan obviate need for repeat imaging by generation of iodine-overlay image and also help in eliminating artifactual pseudoenhancement which can be problematic, especially in small endophytic cysts. Contrast- enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is extremely sensitive in identification of enhancing components in indeterminate masses, especially in the setting of renal failure as the microbubbles are not excreted via the renal route. The Bosniak classification for renal cystic masses has been revised in 2019 to standardize terminology and further improve upon the original version. The current version includes CT and MRI, although CEUS is yet to be included. Image- guided biopsy of renal mass helps confirm the diagnosis and also gives information regarding the subtype and grading and is useful in avoiding overtreatment of benign entities, and in active surveillance. Multiparametric MRI can potentially help avoid needle biopsy in a subset of patients by accurate characterization through a previously validated algorithm.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To collect research articles, we used the following terms to create the search: (exercise [Title] OR physical activity [Title] OR training [Title]) AND (rats [Title/Abstract] OR rat [Title/Abstract] OR rattus [Title/Abstract]). To best cover targeted studies, publication dates were limited to \"within 11 years.\" The exercise intervention methods used for different diseases were sorted according to the mode, frequency, and intensity of exercise.The collected articles were categorized into studies related to 6 systems or disease types: motor system (17 articles), metabolic system (110 articles), cardiocerebral vascular system (171 articles), nervous system (71 articles), urinary system (2 articles), and cancer (21 articles). Our review found that, for different diseases, exercise intervention mostly had a positive effect. However, the most powerful effect was achieved by using a specific mode of exercise that addressed the characteristics of the disease.As a model animal, rats not only provide a convenient resource for studying human diseases but also provide the possibility for exploring the molecular mechanisms of exercise intervention on diseases.

        "abstract": "Podoplanin (PDPN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates tumor cell-induced platelets aggregation in different cancer types. Emerging data indicate that PDPN is a marker for poor prognosis of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the functional impacts of PDPN on cancer formation and disease progression of OSCC remain to be elucidated.The sublines of the OECM-1 oral cancer cells with PDPN knockdown or overexpression were established. The cellular characteristics and the ability to induce platelet aggregation of these cells lines were analyzed. An ectopic xenograft animal model by inoculating cancer cells into the anterior neck region of nude mice was established to investigate the functional impact of PDPN on disease progression and cancer-associated thrombosis of OSCC.PDPN promoted OSCC cell migration and invasion, but had no effect on cell proliferation in&#160;vitro and tumor growth in&#160;vivo. Co-incubation of PDPN-positive (PDPN+) OSCC cells with platelets induced platelet activation and aggregation. The mice bearing PDPN+ tumor had a decrease in overall survival despite that there was no gross appearance of distant metastasis. A speckled immunofluorescence staining pattern of platelet marker mCD41 was defined in the PDPN+ tumor sections and the intensity was greater than in the PDPN-low or negative tumor sections. Co-immunofluorescence staining of the tumor sections with mCD41 and the endothelial cell marker mCD31 further demonstrated that platelet aggregates were located in the lumen of blood vessel and were also distributed intratumorally in the mice bearing PDPN+ tumors.These data demonstrated that PDPN expression in the cancer cells is associated with high risk of thrombosis, leading to unfavorable overall survival of the mice. This study provides new insights into the functions of PDPN in cancer-associated thrombosis and in the pathophysiology of OSCC.Copyright &#169; 2019 Chang Gung University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma, ranking as the second primary cause of cancer-related death, is the most common type of bone cancer. Doxorubicin (DOX) is used as a first-line treatment for osteosarcoma; however, the tumour recurrence rate remains high. Recent studies have suggested that DOX-induced migration and stemness in osteosarcoma cells might be the primary reason of recurrence and drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, it is urgent to explore novel effective treatments to overcome DOX-induced drug resistance of osteosarcoma.Osteosarcoma cells KHOS and U2OS were treated with DOX and apatinib (AP) alone or in combination. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate effects on proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to assess cell apoptosis. Cell migration was determined by the transwell assay. Cancer stemness was detected by flow cytometry analysis of CD133+ cells and sphere-formation assay. Western blot assay was used to measure the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/p-STAT3, SRY-box2 (Sox2) and octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct4), and Nanog in treated osteosarcoma cells.Herein, we revealed that AP treatment significantly enhanced the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to DOX, reversed the DOX-induced stemness phenotype and metastasis capacity of osteosarcoma cells, and abolished the upregulation of p-STAT3, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog. We further demonstrated that AP reversed DOX-induced stemness and migration of osteosarcoma cells through Sox2.These results suggested that AP significantly abolished the DOX-induced stemness phenotype and metastasis capacity in osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting Sox2 via STAT3 signalling.Our study indicates that Doxorubicin-based chemotherapeutics may simulate cancer stem cells (CSCs) properties in osteosarcoma, leading to the resistance of osteosarcoma. Apatinib can reduce the Doxorubicin-induced chemoresistance through STAT3/Sox2 pathway inactivation. This study represents that Apatinib may act as an effective chemotherapy sensitiser for reducing chemoresistance correlated with CSCs in osteosarcoma.&#169; 2019 The Authors.",

The present study highlighted the presence of multiple HPV infection (186 of 207, 89.9%) along with HPV-16 in women with cervical cancer. In control, 27.3% were co-infected with other sexually transmitted infections, while Chlamydia trachomatis infection was seen in 13% of cases.The study highlighted the type of HPV infection seen among the hospital-based population. For better screening, HPV tests available in the market should include all the types seen in the population.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer among women, worldwide. HIV-positive women tend to have persistent infection and infection with multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) types. There is a need for affordable HPV DNA tests as viable alternatives to the existing costly commercial assays. The aim of the study was to establish PGMY-CHUV reverse hybridization assay as a cost-effective tool for HPV genotyping.This was a prospective study conducted in a tertiary care centre from March 2011 to July 2012.Fifty cervical brush samples from HIV-infected women and 43 WHO reference samples were tested by both the CHUV assay and linear array (LA).The CHUV assay in comparison to the LA showed a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 52% and a moderate agreement for all samples that were compared. However, most high-risk HPV types were identified amongst the clinical samples, and the entire range of genotypes in the WHO reference panel was detected.The accuracy indices such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated. The level of agreement (kappa value) between the two assays was also calculated.The CHUV assay had an acceptable sensitivity, but it lacked specificity for HPV detection. Despite the lower rates of detection of multiple infections from clinical samples, better results were obtained with the WHO reference samples and the ability of the assay to identify the entire range of genotypes suggests that it can be an efficient tool for genotyping.",

        "abstract": "Identifying infectious pathogens by collecting intravenous blood (IVB) is a well-established procedure, however, the collection of IVB in field epidemiological study is challenging. The dried blood spot (DBS) as an alternative to IVB has been introduced, although, there is a limited study to demonstrate the utility of DBS stored at various storage conditions and transported at different periods. This is an observational study, which evaluates the effectiveness of DBS in field epidemiological studies to identify infectious pathogens.A total of 264 paired DBS samples prepared from IVB, stored at 4&#176;C, -20&#176;C after period 24, 48 and 72 h. Serologically, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] IgG antibody detected against Helicobacter pylori infection from DBS and compared with IVB.Quantitatively, IgG antibody reactivity showed >87% correlation between IVB and DBS samples stored at 4&#176;C or -20&#176;C within 48 h of transport duration. DBS stored at 4&#176;C shows, equal sensitivity 87.5% and specificity 95% before 48 h of transport duration, while at -20&#176;C storage similar sensitivity 87.5% observed but slightly less specificity 86.36% observed as compared to 24 h of transport duration. One-way analysis of variance showed, nonsignificant difference at both (-20&#176;C and 4&#176;C) the stored condition with P value (P > 0.851) and (P > 0.477). Kappa values showed good inter-rater reliability between DBS and IVB in a range (0.77-0.81).No significant difference was observed in detecting H. pylori when ELISA was conducted using IVB or DBS stored at 4&#176;C and transported even after 48 h. This confirms that DBS collected even in compromised conditions in the field can be used for detecting infection.",

First, the operation should start with dissection of the posterior portion of the hilar and lower paratracheal nodes, which will provide excellent visualization of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and also facilitate dissection of the subaortic and para-aortic (aorto-pulmonary) nodes. Second, the lower paratracheal nodes and aorto-pulmonary nodes should be mobilized together with their dominant lymphatic drainage pathways from the left upper lobe. During this procedure, care must be taken not to divide the peribronchial lymphatic pathway toward the lower paratracheal nodes or the subpleural lymphatic pathway toward the aorto-pulmonary nodes.&#160; By following these guidelines, the left upper lobe and the regional lymph nodes can be resected en bloc without any division of their lymphatic connection. We believe that this procedure will help prevent pleural dissemination as well as prevent the surgeon's missing any metastatic lymph nodes.&#169; The Author 2016.

        "abstract": "Cells actively interact with their microenvironment, constantly sensing and modulating biochemical and biophysical signals. Blood comprises a variety of non-adherent cells that interact with each other and with endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel walls. Blood cells are further experiencing a range of external forces by the hemodynamic environment and they also exert forces to remodel their local environment. Therefore, the biophysics and material properties of blood cells and blood play an important role in determining blood behaviour in health and disease. In this Review, we discuss blood cells and tissues from a materials perspective, considering the mechanical properties and biophysics of individual blood cells and endothelial cells as well as blood cell collectives. We highlight how blood vessels provide a mechanosensitive barrier between blood and tissues and how changes in vessel stiffness and flow shear stress can be correlated to plaque formation and exploited for the design of vascular grafts. We discuss the effect of the properties of fibrin on blood clotting, and investigate how forces exerted by platelets are correlated to disease. Finally, we hypothesize that blood and vascular cells are constantly establishing a mechanical homeostasis, which, when imbalanced, can lead to hematologic and vascular diseases.",

We present herein a new series of diazepane-containing derivatives as &#963;R ligands obtained by a conformational expansion approach of our previously synthesized piperidine-based compounds. The best results were reached by benzofurane 2c, 3c and quinoline 2d, 3d-substituted diazepane derivatives, which showed the highest &#963;R affinity. The cytotoxic activities of synthesized compounds were evaluated against two cancer cell lines, and the results indicated that none of the compounds induced significant toxicity in these cells. We also evaluated the antioxidant activity by radical scavenging capacity of our best compounds on ABTS and H2O2. The results obtained reveal that our new derivatives possess an excellent antioxidant profile and could be protective for the cells. Overall, the benzofurane derivative 2c due to its strong interaction with the active site of the receptor, as confirmed by molecular dynamic simulations, emerged as the optimum compound with high &#963;1R affinity, low cytotoxicity, and a potent antioxidant activity.Copyright &#169; 2019 American Chemical Society.",

In the present study, we examined the expression of human FBXW7 in adult testis, and analyzed fixed sections from adult testes and fetal testes to determine the cell type-specific expression pattern of FBXW7. The results showed that FBXW7&#945; and FBXW7&#946; genes are expressed in the testis; however, only FBXW7&#945; protein could be detected. FBXW7 was not detected in human spermatogonial stem cells. Interestingly, FBXW7 was mainly expressed in the cell nuclei of later stage germ cells and differentiated somatic cells. We also observed high FBXW7 expression in human fetal germ cells, particularly in prespermatogonia. Our results raised the possibility that FBXW7 has different functions in humans and mice. The cell type-specific expression pattern of FBXW7 suggests that it performs regulatory functions during the late stage of human spermatogenesis instead of being involved in the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells.Copyright &#169; 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The duodenal lesion was endoscopically unresectable due to central depression, and the transverse colon adenoma was unresectable because it was confluent with the previous ileocolic anastomosis. Given the synchronous unresectable lesions in the setting of an Amsterdam positive kindred, the patient underwent simultaneous pancreaticoduodenectomy and completion total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. Histopathologic analysis of the specimens revealed T4N0 poorly differentiated MLH1 deficient duodenal adenocarcinoma with pancreatic invasion and tubular adenoma of the colon with high grade dysplasia. Following adjuvant chemotherapy, there is no evidence of recurrent cancer after two years of surveillance.While the crude overall risk for small bowel and periampullary tumors remains low, clinicians must maintain awareness of a relatively increased risk of extracolonic tumors in Lynch syndrome (LS) patients.LS patients have an increased risk for developing small bowel cancer (SBC) when compared to the general population. However, given the low incidence of these tumors and uncertain efficacy of contemporary screening modalities, surveillance of the small bowel has not been recommended. The current case report exemplifies the challenges associated with waiting for patients to develop symptoms to develop before investigating for SBC.",

        "abstract": "The reconstruction of clonal haplotypes and their evolutionary history in evolving populations is a common problem in both microbial evolutionary biology and cancer biology. The clonal theory of evolution provides a theoretical framework for modeling the evolution of clones.In this paper, we review the theoretical framework and assumptions over which the clonal reconstruction problem is formulated. We formally define the problem and then discuss the complexity and solution space of the problem. Various methods have been proposed to find the phylogeny that best explains the observed data. We categorize these methods based on the type of input data that they use (space-resolved or time-resolved), and also based on their computational formulation as either combinatorial or probabilistic. It is crucial to understand the different types of input data because each provides essential but distinct information for drastically reducing the solution space of the clonal reconstruction problem. Complementary information provided by single cell sequencing or from whole genome sequencing of randomly isolated clones can also improve the accuracy of clonal reconstruction. We briefly review the existing algorithms and their relationships. Finally we summarize the tools that are developed for either directly solving the clonal reconstruction problem or a related computational problem.In this review, we discuss the various formulations of the problem of inferring the clonal evolutionary history from allele frequeny data, review existing algorithms and catergorize them according to their problem formulation and solution approaches. We note that most of the available clonal inference algorithms were developed for elucidating tumor evolution whereas clonal reconstruction for unicellular genomes are less addressed. We conclude the review by discussing more open problems such as the lack of benchmark datasets and comparison of performance between available tools.",

        "abstract": "Gaussian graphical models are useful tools for exploring network structures in multivariate normal data. In this paper we are interested in situations where data show departures from Gaussianity, therefore requiring alternative modeling distributions. The multivariate t-distribution, obtained by dividing each component of the data vector by a gamma random variable, is a straightforward generalization to accommodate deviations from normality such as heavy tails. Since different groups of variables may be contaminated to a different extent, Finegold and Drton (2014) introduced the Dirichlet t-distribution, where the divisors are clustered using a Dirichlet process. In this work, we consider a more general class of nonparametric distributions as the prior on the divisor terms, namely the class of normalized completely random measures (NormCRMs). To improve the effectiveness of the clustering, we propose modeling the dependence among the divisors through a nonparametric hierarchical structure, which allows for the sharing of parameters across the samples in the data set. This desirable feature enables us to cluster together different components of multivariate data in a parsimonious way. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach provides accurate graphical model inference, and apply it to a case study examining the dependence structure in radiomics data derived from The Cancer Imaging Atlas.",

        "abstract": "In observational studies, estimation of a causal effect of a treatment on an outcome relies on proper adjustment for confounding. If the number of the potential confounders (p) is larger than the number of observations (n), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable Xj is strongly associated with the treatment T but weakly with the outcome Y, the coefficient &#946;j will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients &#946;j corresponding to the potential confounders Xj . Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients (&#946;j s) of the Xj s that are strongly associated with T but weakly associated with Y. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the causal effects of persistent pesticide exposure on triglyceride levels.",

The mean age of all participants was 50 &#177; 36.3 years, and female patients were predominant (83.3%). Eighteen perforator flaps, five random-pattern flaps, three free flaps, three tissue expander flaps, and one full-thickness skin graft were employed, with no instances of recurrence or complications, except for total flap loss in two cases. The median length of stay was 43 days.

Actor Partner Interdependence Models in Mplus with demographic covariates tested whether parent and adolescent perceived social isolation (2 items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale) were associated with each person's self-reported health. Most dyads included a mother (38% mother-daughter, 36% mother-son).&#160;Most parents were non-Hispanic White (69%), married/partnered (77%), and reported household income below $100,000 (79%).

There were negative associations between parent isolation and parent health, adolescent isolation and adolescent health, and parent isolation and adolescent health (all ps&#8201;<&#8201;.05), but no association between adolescent isolation and parent health. The finding that parents' social isolation was linked to lower self-reported health not only for themselves but also for their adolescent children highlights the importance of addressing social isolation in clinical social work practice.

There is paucity of data on MRD and outcome in ALL from India. We share our experience in establishing a flow cytometry-based MRD assay for ALL with emphasis on determination of the number of patients who had MRD on day 35 of induction therapy and its correlation with outcome and other prognostic factors. We prospectively studied MRD in patients with ALL less than 25&#160;years who achieved morphological complete remission with induction therapy. The initial series consisted of 104 patients with ALL. Ninety-two patients had bone marrow samples collected on day 35 of remission induction chemotherapy that was adequate for MRD. Strategy of monitoring MRD was based on flow cytometry using six color staining according the leukemia associated immunophenotype found at diagnosis. Data analysis was done using Fisher exact test. The median age was 8.5&#160;years (range 0.9-22&#160;years). Thirty-seven out of ninety-two patients (40.2%) had MRD at end of induction. MRD on day 35 was between 0.01 and 0.1% in 18.9% of patients, between 0.1 and 1% in 59.5% and more than 1% in 21.6% patients. Among the patients who had MRD, 16.7% had favourable cytogenetics, 60% had intermediate and 13.3% had high-risk cytogenetics. The presence or absence of residual leukemia by flow cytometry at day 35 was not significantly related to age (p&#8201;=&#8201;1.0), male gender (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.08) hyperleukocytosis (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.25) or day 8 blast clearance (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.21). However, T cell phenotype (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) was significantly associated with MRD.

The 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients who had MRD versus those who did not was 72.5% and 61.1% respectively (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.33). Flow cytometric techniques can be applied to monitor MRD in patients of ALL undergoing induction therapy. Our results suggest MRD correlates with certain known prognostic factors. Though the EFS and OS was lower in MRD positive patients, the results were not statistically significant probably because of the small sample size.&#169; Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion 2019.",

We present our experience of 16 patients of NK/T cell lymphoma which constituted approximately 1% of all lymphoma (N&#8201;=&#8201;1590) cases treated at our center. Male to female ratio was 4.3:1. Median age of presentation was 42&#160;years. Early Stage patients (n&#8201;=&#8201;11) were treated with DeVIC regimen (n&#8201;=&#8201;10) and SMILE (n&#8201;=&#8201;1) chemotherapy and RT to all the patients. Advanced stage patients were treated with SMILE regimen (n&#8201;=&#8201;4) and ICE and local RT (n&#8201;=&#8201;1) with one treatment related mortality. The presence of B-symptoms adversely affected survival. The estimated median PFS and OS were 39 and 49&#160;months respectively. Overall survival was not reached in Limited Stage patients (stage 1 and 2) and 8&#160;months in patients with advanced stage (stage IV) (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). According to the new CSWOG staging (retrospectively applied), comparing the Limited versus Extensive Stage, the earlier group has a significantly better estimated PFS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.020) and OS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.007). ENKTL is a rare malignancy with aggressive course. B-symptoms portend a poor prognosis to patients with this aggressive lymphoma.

This study was conducted at the dental clinic of the Medical, Oral and Biotechnology Sciences Department of Chieti in February 2015. A 36-year-old male patient, D.G.M., had a mandibular inflammatory cyst (with a diameter of about 33.9x20.3mm) treated by surgical enucleation, subsequent apicectomy of the elements involved (4.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) and coverage of residual defect with a porcine cortical bone barrier (Bone Lamina). Postoperative clinical and radiographic examinations were performed at 3 and 9 months (panoramic radiographs) and at 12 and 24 months (CBCT Dental scan) respectively after cystic enucleation surgery. Uneventful healing and filling of the residual cavity was carried out. The computed analysis of the postoperative radiographs showed bone regeneration of cortical in terms of thickness increase at 12 and 24 months and showed mean values of reduction in size of the residual cavity of 92.1% after 12 months and 96.53% after 24 months. The volume of residual cavity (3123 mm3 in 2015) was seen to decrease (243.6mm3 at 12 months and 108.5 mm3 at 24 months). In this case report the Bone Lamina prevented tissue collapse within the defect and could maintain structural integrity throughout the period required for bone regeneration; it also has the advantage of resorbable membranes, avoiding a second surgery for its removal.Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.",

This enables novel biological insights and inspires new approaches to the treatment of diseases. Cancer cells frequently exhibit altered glycolysis and glucose metabolism and an increased glucose demand. Thus, targeting glucose uptake and metabolism may open up novel opportunities for the discovery of compounds that differentiate between normal and malignant cells. This review discusses the different chemical approaches to the development of novel inhibitors of glucose uptake through facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs), and focusses on the most advanced and potent inhibitor classes known to date.

        "abstract": "Lung tumors, especially those located close to or surrounded by soft tissues like the mediastinum, are difficult to segment due to the low soft tissue contrast on computed tomography images. Magnetic resonance images contain superior soft-tissue contrast information that can be leveraged if both modalities were available for training. Therefore, we developed a cross-modality educed learning approach where MR information that is educed from CT is used to hallucinate MRI and improve CT segmentation. Our approach, called cross-modality educed deep learning segmentation (CMEDL) combines CT and pseudo MR produced from CT by aligning their features to obtain segmentation on CT. Features computed in the last two layers of parallelly trained CT and MR segmentation networks are aligned. We implemented this approach on U-net and dense fully convolutional networks (dense-FCN). Our networks were trained on unrelated cohorts from open-source the Cancer Imaging Archive CT images (N=377), an internal archive T2-weighted MR (N=81), and evaluated using separate validation (N=304) and testing (N=333) CT-delineated tumors. Our approach using both networks were significantly more accurate (U-net P < 0.001; denseFCN P < 0.001) than CT-only networks and achieved an accuracy (Dice similarity coefficient) of 0.71&#177;0.15 (U-net), 0.74&#177;0.12 (denseFCN) on validation and 0.72&#177;0.14 (U-net), 0.73&#177;0.12 (denseFCN) on the testing sets. Our novel approach demonstrated that educing cross-modality information through learned priors enhances CT segmentation performance.",

        "abstract": "The accumulation of reactive &#945;-dicarbonyl leading to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been linked to pathophysiological diseases in many studies, such as atherosclerosis, cataract, cancer, and diabetic nephropathy. Glycation-generated AGEs increase the expression of inflammatory cytokines by transferring signals to the cell by binding them to the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) on their cell surface. The effect of methylglyoxal-derived AGEs (AGE-4) on the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in rat ordinary kidney cells (NRK-52E) was explored in this research, among other AGEs. The cell treated with 100&#160;&#956;g/mL AGE-4 for 24&#160;h showed a substantial rise in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression relative to BSA control only and other AGEs through ERK, JNK, and NF-B pathways. Our findings therefore suggest that AGE-4 expresses MMPs through the AGE-4-RAGE axis, activating MAPK signals that may contribute to dysfunction of the kidney cell.&#169; The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.",

In around 10% of patients, gastroscopy is presumed to have missed oesophagogastric (OG) cancer prior to diagnosis. We examine patient, endoscopist and service level factors that may affect rates of missed OG cancers.Gastroscopies presumed to have missed OG cancers performed up to 3 years prior to diagnosis were identified over 6 years in Sheffield, UK. Factors related to the patient, endoscopist and endoscopy lists were examined in a case-control study. Procedures which missed cancer were compared with two procedure controls: the procedures which subsequently diagnosed cancer in the same patient, and second, endoscopist matched procedures diagnostic of small benign focal lesions.We identified 48 (7.7%) cases of missed OG cancer. Endoscopy lists on which OG cancer diagnoses were missed contained a greater number of total procedures compared with lists on which diagnoses were subsequently made (OR 1.42 95%&#8201;CI 1.13 to 1.78) and when compared with lists during which matched endoscopists diagnosed benign small focal lesions (OR 1.25, 95%&#8201;CI 1.02 to 1.52).

We asked smokers and recent quitters (n=11838) whether they had a medical diagnosis for heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, depression, anxiety, alcohol problems, diabetes, severe obesity and chronic pain (nine conditions), and whether they believed smoking had harmed/would harm their health, along with questions on quitting activities.General concerns about smoking harming health and all specific health conditions, except for alcohol problems, were positively associated with quit attempts, but the relationships between health conditions and other quitting measures (being abstinent, planning to quit, use of quitting medications) were less consistent. Positive associations between conditions and use of quitting medications were only significant for depression, anxiety and chronic pain (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.4 to 1.5). There was a general tendency to report lower self-efficacy for quitting among those with the health conditions.While those with smoking related conditions are somewhat more aware of the links to their smoking, and are largely taking more action, the extent of this is lower than one might reasonably expect. Enhanced awareness campaigns are needed and health professionals need to do more to use health conditions to motivate quit attempts and to ensure they are made with the most effective forms of help.&#169; 2019 Li L.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between work loss and smoking has not been studied extensively, and underlying factors are often not examined. The aim of this study was to test two hypotheses. First, work loss is associated with greater intention to quit and more likelihood of smoking cessation, and this relationship is moderated by a decrease in income. Second, work loss is associated with lower quit intention and lower rates of smoking cessation, and this relationship is moderated by an increase in psychological distress.We used pooled data from three countries participating in the ITC Project: France, Germany and the Netherlands (n=2712). We measured unemployment, income and psychological distress at two consecutive survey waves, and calculated changes between survey waves. We first conducted multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the association between work loss and smoking cessation behavior. Next, we added income decrease and psychological distress increase to the models. Finally, we added interaction terms of work loss by income decrease and work loss by distress increase to the model.Work loss was not associated with quit intention, quit attempts, and quit success. When income decrease and psychological distress increase were added to the model, we found a positive association between distress increase and quit attempts. The interactions, however, were not statistically significant.Our results indicate that smokers who become unemployed and face a decrease in income are not less likely to quit smoking than smokers who are employed.&#169; 2019 Hummel K.",

All analyses were weighted. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted associations between variables of interest.The NATS results showed that 32.4% of Lao people aged &#8805;15 years were current tobacco users (men: 51.2%, women: 15.4%). Cigarette smoking accounted for approximately 95% of all tobacco use in men, while tobacco chewing accounted for 60% of tobacco use in women. Current tobacco use was strongly associated with older ages and lower education levels (p<0.001). There were interactions between sex, education level, and income associated with tobacco use; specifically, women were more likely to have a lower education level and lower income than men, and these women were more likely to use tobacco.Tobacco use prevalence in Lao PDR was among the highest in the region. There were variations in types and prevalence of tobacco use across sociodemographic subpopulations. The Lao government should continue current national tobacco control efforts and implement additional proven strategies to reduce tobacco use.&#169; 2019 Xangsayarath P.",

One way to predict which non-user adolescents and young adults are most likely to use these products is through measuring their susceptibility or openness to using the products.We conducted a national phone survey (baseline) and an internet survey (follow-up) of adolescents and young adults (ages 13-25 years), who, at baseline, had never used WP (N=1002) or LCC (N=990). At baseline, we measured susceptibility using a single item, asking participants whether they would try WP or LCC if their best friend offered it to them, and subsequently measured uptake at follow-up. We conducted multivariate regression analyses to determine whether product-specific susceptibility was a significant predictor of uptake at follow-up.Participants who were susceptible and participants who had ever used another tobacco product had higher odds of using WP (AOR=3.5, AOR=4.2) and LCC (AOR=3.2, AOR=5.3) at follow-up than those who were not susceptible to those products, and had not ever used tobacco products respectively, controlling for sociodemographic factors. The one-item measure had adequate sensitivity (WP=51.4%, LCC=40.2%) and specificity (WP=84.9%, LCC=87.9%).Our national study of US adolescents and young adults shows that a one-item susceptibility measure at baseline was a significant predictor of WP and LCC uptake at follow-up, even after controlling for other predictors. Future research should assess the predictive validity of the one-item compared to the multi-item scale.&#169; 2019 Orlan E.N.",

        "abstract": "Immunotherapy can take advantage of the immunogenic response that chemotherapy elicits in tumors. Gemcitabine is a standard agent used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, with known effects on the tumor immune microenvironment. The combination immunotherapy of the GVAX cancer vaccine, anti-PD-1 antibody and anti-CSF-1R antibody has been shown to improve survival in a murine model of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This combination regimen also increased the infiltration of CD8+ T-cells that expressed both PD1 and CD137, and these T-cells were shown to express high levels of interferon-gamma, a marker of cytotoxic effector CD8+ T-cells. The effect of the addition of gemcitabine to this promising immunotherapy regimen has not been investigated.Mice with liver-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were followed for 120 days to determine if adding immunotherapy, which comprised of varying combinations of GVAX, anti-PD-1 antibody and anti-CSF-1R antibody, to gemcitabine improved survival. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells and myeloid cells, harvested after the mice were treated for 2 weeks, were analyzed with flow cytometry to characterize the effect the chemo-immunotherapy regimen had on the tumor microenvironment (TME).Adding combination immunotherapy after gemcitabine improved survival compared to gemcitabine treatment alone (gemcitabine/GVAX/anti-PD1, P<0.001; gemcitabine/anti-PD1/anti-CSF-1R, P<0.05; gemcitabine/GVAX/anti-PD1/anti-CSF-1R, P<0.01). However, there was no difference in survival between the three chemo-immunotherapy treatment regimens. Compared to gemcitabine-only treatment, the chemo-immunotherapy regimens also increased the percentage of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells that expressed interferon-gamma (gemcitabine/GVAX/anti-PD1, P<0.0001 and gemcitabine/GVAX/anti-PD1/anti-CSF-1R, P<0.0001). The chemo-immunotherapy regimens also increased the number of tumor-infiltrating PD1+CD137+CD8+ T-cells and interferon-gamma-expressing PD1+CD137+CD8+ T-cells, but these increases were not statistically significant. Anti-CSF-1R antibody decreased the infiltration of myeloid cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells caused by GVAX (P<0.05), and trended towards decreasing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (P=0.18).The addition of anti-PD1 antibody with GVAX and/or anti-CSF-1R antibody to gemcitabine improved the survival of mice with liver-metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Gemcitabine with GVAX and anti-PD1 with or without anti-CSF-1R also improved the infiltration of effector CD8+ T-cells, and the presence of anti-CSF-1R in the chemo-immunotherapy regimens decreased the infiltration of myeloid cells. The overlapping mechanisms of the components in the chemo-immunotherapy regimens may explain the lack of survival difference between the various regimens, and this remains to be explored.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral spinal fluid leak from durotomy is a well-known risk with spinal surgeries. The aim of this study is to identify the incidence of unrecognized incidental durotomy during posterior surgery for spinal metastases and its risk factors.Participants comprised 75 patients who underwent posterior spine surgery for spinal metastases between January 2012 and December 2016. Cases with apparent durotomy noticed intraoperatively were excluded. Unrecognized durotomy was diagnosed as the presence of wide subcutaneous fluid retention on magnetic resonance imaging at least 3 months postoperatively. For comparison, 50 patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty due to cervical spondylotic myelopathy were examined using the same method. We also examined correlations between occurrence of durotomy and patient characteristics such as age, type of tumor, location of tumor (ventral or dorsal), extent of tumor, and history of radiotherapy before surgery.Unrecognized durotomy occurred in 21 cases of spinal metastasis (26.7%) and in 1 case of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (2%), representing a significant difference between groups. Age, type of tumor, location of tumor, extent of tumor, and history of radiotherapy before surgery did not correlate significantly with occurrence of durotomy. No local trouble was observed in durotomy cases, except in one case with subcutaneous local infection.The incidence of unrecognized incidental durotomy is significantly higher during surgery for spinal metastases than that during surgery for degenerative disease.Copyright &#169; 2020 by The Japanese Society for Spine Surgery and Related Research.",

        "title": "Radiological Assessment of Damage to the Iliopsoas Muscle by the Oblique Lateral Interbody Fusion Approach.",
        "abstract": "There are several reports about invasive muscle injury during posterior spinal surgery. However, few reports have evaluated the association between the clinical symptoms and changes in the physical properties of the psoas major after oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF). Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the relationship between the clinical symptoms and changes in the psoas major muscle before and after OLIF.Twenty-seven patients who underwent single-level OLIF following the diagnosis of degenerative lumbar disease were included in the study. The cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the psoas major on the approaching and contralateral sides were measured in the axial computed tomography view of the surgical intervertebral space preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 week and 3, 6, and 12 months. The preoperative and postoperative changes in the CSAs were compared. Muscle degeneration was evaluated using axial magnetic resonance images at the same level as that in the CSA evaluation preoperatively and at 12 months postoperatively. Additionally, the relationship between these parameters and postoperative lower limb symptoms was investigated.Significant swelling of the psoas major on the approach side was observed 1 week postoperatively (p < 0.05). No postoperative muscle degeneration was observed. Three cases of paresthesia in the front of the thigh were observed, but no association was found with changes in CSA in any of the cases.The OLIF approach caused swelling of the psoas major 1 week postoperatively with no more muscle degeneration in the mid-term. Although numbness of the lower limbs was found in some cases, no association was found with changes in CSA. Our study findings suggest that the OLIF approach causes temporary injury or swelling of the psoas major, but the long-term damage to the muscle is not significant.Copyright &#169; 2020 by The Japanese Society for Spine Surgery and Related Research.",

        "abstract": "The risk of malpositioning of the syndesmotic screws is very high. A lack of standard radiological or physical references for accurate syndesmotic screw placement is a potential contributing factor in syndesmotic screw malpositioning. Malleolar tips are clinically as well as radiologically appreciable bony references. The purpose of this preliminary CT based study was to investigate the axial relations of the central syndesmotic axis with the malleolar tips.CT based studies of uninjured adult ankle joints with intact syndesmosis, conducted over a six months period were analysed. The axial differences between the coronal plane along the malleolar tips and that along the central syndesmotic axis in the axial plane were measured. Gender-based variations were also analyzed.A total of 70 CT studies were analyzed, and the axial difference between the malleolar tips based coronal plane and that along the central syndesmotic axis was observed to be 3.70&#8239;&#177;&#8239;5.61&#176;. The male and female measurements were comparable.Being in a static relation to the syndesmosis independent of the foot position and the limb rotation, the malleolar tips can be reliably used as references for directing syndesmotic screw in the axial plane. A knowledge of this axial difference between malleolar tips and central syndesmotic axis can help surgeons in an accurate syndesmotic screw placement.&#169; 2019 Delhi Orthopedic Association.

        "abstract": "Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major obstacle during liver transplantation and resection surgeries for cancer, with a need for effective and safe drugs to reduce IRI. Zinc preconditioning has been shown to protect against liver IRI in a partial (70%) ischaemia model. However, its efficacy against a clinically relevant Pringle manoeuvre that results in global liver ischaemia (100%) is unknown.The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of zinc preconditioning in a rat model of global liver ischaemia.Rats were preconditioned via subcutaneous injection of 10&#160;mg/kg of ZnCl2, 24&#160;h and 4&#160;h before ischaemia. Total liver ischaemia (100%) was induced by placing a clamp across the portal triad for 30&#160;min. Liver injury was assessed by serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in blood taken before ischaemia (baseline)&#160;and at 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after ischaemia. Animals were culled after 7 days, and the harvested livers were histologically analysed.On a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, there was a statistically significant (p&#160;= 0.025) difference in the mean ALT levels between saline- and ZnCl2-treated groups. Specifically at 24&#160;h after ischaemia, the ALT (341&#160;&#177;&#160;99 U/L) and AST (606&#160;&#177;&#160;78 U/L) in the zinc-treated group were significantly less than the ALT (2863&#160;&#177;&#160;828 U/L) and AST (3591&#160;&#177;&#160;948 U/L) values in the saline-treated group. Zinc significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration and necrosis compared with the saline control.Zinc preconditioning reduces the overall hepatocellular damage from IRI. These results lay the foundation to assess the benefit of zinc preconditioning for clinical applications.&#169; 2019 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, these products can only be insert into the market after extensive and well-performed scientific studies that clarify the mechanisms by which bioactive compounds can improve health status beyond nutrition or can replace conventional food additives perceived as \"unhealthy\" or \"unfamiliar\" by consumers. Therefore, scientific evidence regarding the actual health benefits and preservation/enhancement of food attributes are the crucial step in the exploration of nutraceuticals and natural food additives. In this context, several studies have been carried to identify and characterize natural bioactive compounds in aquaculture and related by-products for further production of nutraceuticals and food additives.

        "abstract": "There is a growing concern about chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cancer and cardiovascular diseases resulting from profound changes in the western lifestyle. Aquaculture by-products are generated in large quantities and they can be profitably recycled through their bioactive compounds used for health or food supplements. Improving waste utilization in the field of aquaculture is essential for a sustainable industry to prevent or minimize the environmental impact. In this sense fish by-products are a great source of protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are particularly studied on Atlantic salmon or rainbow trout. Fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) obtained from chemical, enzymatical and microbial hydrolysis of processing by-products are being used as a source of amino acids and peptides with high digestibility, fast absorption and important biological activities. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) from fish discards have been reported to decrease postprandial triacylglycerol levels, reduction of blood pressure, platelet aggregation and the inflammatory response. Crustacean by-products can also be used to produce chitosan with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity for food and pharmaceutical industries and carotenoids with important biological activity. Seaweeds are rich in bioactive compounds such as alginate, carrageenan, agar, carotenoids and polyphenols with different biological activities such as antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, regarding harvest microalgae, during the past decades, they were mainly used in the healthy food market, with >75% of the annual microalgal biomass production, used for the manufacture of powders, tablets, capsules or pills. We will report and discuss the present and future role of aquaculture by-products as sources of biomolecules for the design and development of functional foods/beverages. This chapter will focus on the main bioactive compounds from aquaculture by-products as functional compounds in food and their applications in biomedicine for the prevention and treatment of diseases.&#169; 2020 Elsevier Inc.

        "title": "Stabilization of MORC2 by estrogen and antiestrogens through GPER1- PRKACA-CMA pathway contributes to estrogen-induced proliferation and endocrine resistance of breast cancer cells.",
        "abstract": "Aberrant activation of estrogen signaling through three ESR (estrogen receptor) subtypes, termed ESR1/ER&#945;, ESR2/ER&#946;, and GPER1 (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1), is implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis and progression. Antiestrogens tamoxifen (TAM) and fulvestrant (FUL) are effective for treatment of ESR1-positive breast tumors, but development of resistance represents a major clinical challenge. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these events remain largely unknown. Here, we report that 17&#946;-estradiol (E2), TAM, and FUL stabilize MORC2 (MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2), an emerging oncoprotein in human cancer, in a GPER1-dependent manner. Mechanistically, GPER1 activates PRKACA (protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha), which in turn phosphorylates MORC2 at threonine 582 (T582). Phosphorylated MORC2 decreases its interaction with HSPA8 (heat shock protein family A [Hsp70] member 8) and LAMP2A (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A), two core components of the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) machinery, thus protecting MORC2 from lysosomal degradation by CMA. Functionally, knockdown of MORC2 attenuates E2-induced cell proliferation and enhances cellular sensitivity to TAM and FUL. Moreover, introduction of wild-type MORC2, but not its phosphorylation-lacking mutant (T582A), in MORC2-depleted cells restores resistance to antiestrogens. Clinically, the phosphorylation levels of MORC2 at T582 are elevated in breast tumors from patients undergoing recurrence after TAM treatment. Together, these findings delineate a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for MORC2 stabilization in response to estrogen and antiestrogens via blocking CMA-mediated lysosomal degradation and uncover a dual role for MORC2 in both estrogen-induced proliferation and resistance to antiestrogen therapies of breast cancer cells.4-OHT: 4-hydroxytamoxifen; Baf A1: bafilomycin A1; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; E2: 17&#946;-estradiol; ESR: estrogen receptor; FUL: fulvestrant; GPER1: G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1; HSPA8: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8; LAMP2A: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A; MORC2: MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2; PRKACA: protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha; TAM: tamoxifen; VCL: vinculin.",

        "abstract": "Granular cell tumors (GCTs) or Abrikossoff's tumors are rare neoplasms known to originate from Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. These lesions are usually benign; malignancy only occurs in 1-2% of cases. Surgical resection is the traditional treatment method for GCTs, but it poses several risks and disadvantages related to the surgical incompatibility of the patient, the extended recovery time, and the chance of relapse. Cryoablation is becoming an increasingly favored method of treatment for tumors, both benign and malignant, due to its minimal invasiveness, natural analgesic properties, and ability to stimulate antitumor immunity. Cryoablation may contribute to the prevention of secondary and metastatic tumor growth in cases of malignancy by preserving tumor-associated antigen molecules for recognition by cell-mediated immunity.This article describes a novel method for GCT treatment using cryoablation. This technique exposes tumor tissue to extreme cold temperatures, effectively destroying tumor cells by irreversibly compromising their plasma membranes. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of cryoablative techniques being used for GCT.Cryoablation of this mass was successful with no complications. CT images during the procedure demonstrated circumferential coverage of the entire lesion with no injury to the surrounding tissues.Cryoablation can be used as an alternative to surgical intervention to treat malignant GCTs. This procedure is minimally invasive, less painful, and potentially effective in promoting antitumor immunity.Copyright &#169; 2020 by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

In total, 223 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from patients diagnosed with primary and metastatic CRC as well as with nonneoplastic inflamed colon mucosa were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for the presence of JCPyV large tumor antigen (LT-Ag) sequences.JCPyV LT-Ag sequences were detected in 18.6% of the CRC tissues and in 15.5% of the nonneoplastic control group. Viral LT-Ag was quantified in 18/100 primary colon adenocarcinomas, 2/10 metastatic adenocarcinomas, and 1/3 primary adenocarcinomas of the rectum. Two JCPyV-positive metastatic tumors presented a negative test result for JCPyV in the corresponding primary tumor. The median JCPyV LT-Ag copy number was 64 &#215; 10<sup>-2</sup> per cell and 14 &#215; 10<sup>-2</sup> per cell in the CRC cases and the nonneoplastic samples, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two study groups regarding median LT-Ag DNA load (p = 0.059). Among the JCPyV-positive samples, the LT-Ag DNA load was higher in 2 metastatic tumors (from a patient with lung metastasis: 232 &#215; 10<sup>-2</sup> copies per cell; from a patient with liver metastasis: 121 &#215; 10<sup>-2</sup> copies per cell).The detection of JCPyV DNA at low copy numbers (lower than 1 viral copy per cell equivalent) and the absence of viral sequences in the corresponding primary tumors of the JCPyV-positive metastatic samples weaken the hypothesis of an etiological role of JCPyV in primary CRC induction.Copyright &#169; 2020 by S.

Nevertheless, their exact role as tumor suppressors or promoters is not straightforward in colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, expression values of these PPARs and their relation with tumor progression and prognosis were examined in CRC patients.In this work, the relative expression values of the PPARs were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 100 CRC tumor tissues paired with adjacent normal tissues. After that, the association between relative expression values of the PPARs in tumor tissues and the cancer progression-related clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival of patients were assessed.While PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#948; seemed to be overexpressed, PPAR&#947; was suppressed in CRC tumor tissues compared with paired adjacent normal tissues (p = 0.0001). The relative expressions of PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#948; were negatively associated with tumor size, tumor grade, TNM stage, metastasis, lymphatic invasion, and decreased overall survival time (p < 0.05). The same associations, but in reverse direction, were found for PPAR&#947;.It was found that PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#948; were overexpressed while PPAR&#947; was suppressed in CRC tumor tissues, and these deregulations are associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis.Copyright &#169; 2020 by S.
